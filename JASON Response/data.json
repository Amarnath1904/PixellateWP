The current prevalence rate has been estimated to be about 1 in 68, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Because the range of symptoms varies so widely, it can be difficult to quickly describe what this condition is in a way that applies to all children on the spectrum (contrary to public perception, autism can be variously expressed in different people).</p>\n<p>Generally, these children have speech and social deficits. Tantrums can be a common expression because they lack the communication skills to communicate&nbsp;their needs and feelings.</p>\n<p>While some show extraordinary aptitudes in certain areas, many have trouble learning in the same way as their non-autistic peers. Therefore, teaching has to be highly specialized to accommodate the unique ways these children&nbsp;take in and process information. Proper educational tools and strategies can help these kids better integrate with social settings and even the world around them.</p>\n<p>So how can Gamification help?</p>\n<p>According to Natalie Webber, M.S, \u201cThe iPad has become a great tool when working with students on the autism spectrum because it gives them the ability to control a piece of their environment and an opportunity to communicate.\u201d</p>\n<p>The number of apps being developed for autism spectrum children has soared due to the high demand for such tools. Here are ten that are highly recommended.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>1. Book Creator</h3>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/M0J9ptwcGLw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Though Book Creator is not an app that is explicitly intended for autism spectrum kids, it is nonetheless a great tool which can be adapted to serve as a highly customized learning tool for individual children.</p>\n<p>Typical teaching programs for many autism spectrum children (ASC) relies on flash cards and rote learning. But learning (for anyone) can always be enriched by creating new associations between the information and real life.</p>\n<p>With the help of an adult, Book Creator gives autism spectrum kids a chance to form deeper and meaningful connections by creating and arranging photos, voice recordings, videos, music and text into an actual book. A book can be made around different themes within the child\u2019s own life such as: school, meal times at home, outings, taking care of pets, etc.</p>\n<p>Also the process of creating a book and exploring the content gives kids a greater sense of autonomy and the ability to make better sense of their surroundings, a good utilization of Core Drive #3, Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback.</p>\n<h3>2. AutisMate</h3>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XU108CH3sH4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Kids on the autistic spectrum need to be taught how to interact in a variety of settings. This includes simple activities like washing hands or brushing teeth, using utensils for eating, or learning how to play at school or in the playground.</p>\n<p>Teaching rules of engagement and simple processes in life can be met with enormous resistance. A child with poor language comprehension and communication skills may find such lessons to be frustrating.</p>\n<p>Many of the children on the autism spectrum, however, do enjoy looking at images and drawings. Therefore, it can be helpful to use dynamic media like AutisMate where kids can explore different scenarios and settings in a way that helps them feel a sense of control over their learning (Core Drive #4, Ownership &amp;&nbsp;Possession). This can be a great preliminary step prior to practicing new skills in a real life setting.</p>\n<p>Additional features within the app include:</p>\n<p>(1) A visual scheduler to help kids understand linear sequences of steps and/or activities.</p>\n<p>(2) A section for constructing sentences to help kids communicate what they\u2019ve learned in a proper sentence format.</p>\n<h3>3. Proloquo2Go</h3>\n<p><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zuKv0Z2_HMo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Communication is a major challenge for children on the autism spectrum. Proloquo2Go offers an entire library of nouns, actions, sentence fragments and other parts of speech. There are over 14,000 language components. Each of these items can be compiled into a personal set or collection which has to do with a particular theme. For example, a parent may want to create their own library of language items that have to do with going to the grocery store.</p>\n<p>An adult would need to show the child what sentences to use to express certain needs or ideas.</p>\n<p>At the grocery store, the child can choose these keys on the visual display screen of their app. Each of these sentence fragment keys also includes audio, so the child understands how the words sounds..</p>\n<p>They can construct their sentences and verbally speak them to communicate with their parent, instead of feeling upset and throwing a tantrum. This gives them a strong feeling of Core Drive #4, Ownership &amp;&nbsp;Possession and Core Drive #2, Development&amp; Accomplishment).</p>\n<p><strong>4. Choiceworks&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/H6lBfRYK6Nc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Although it may not be immediately obvious, many children on the autistic spectrum enjoy high degrees of structure and routine. Since they experience language and comprehension delays, being directed by adults from one activity to the next can be a difficult source of anguish.</p>\n<p>Abrupt transitions from doing homework, going to the store and sitting down for dinner can cause kids to feel huge amounts of stress since they don\u2019t quite understand what is going on. Instead, it is often best to visually present a sequence of activities so that they can anticipate what is coming next, well ahead of time.</p>\n<p>Choiceworks allows parents and caregivers to construct these types of schedules to help autistic kids feel a greater sense of predictability over their day (Core Drive #4, Ownership &amp;&nbsp;Possession).</p>\n<p>Also this format is far more engaging and interesting to them, compared to the more traditional tools such as&nbsp;cards and poster board schedulers.</p>\n<h3>5. Pictello</h3>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9B1fAaAS3N4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>A multimedia approach is a great way to present information to autistic kids. Pictello is another great tool which uses different forms of media to help parents and autism spectrum children prepare for new situations, including social engagements.</p>\n<p>Users have the ability to create books and \u201ctalking photo albums.\u201d It offers a visual reference, which helps enormously with language comprehension and the simultaneous audio allows them to understand how to pronounce words. The app aims to support children in&nbsp;developing greater levels of expressive speech.</p>\n<p>Parents and educators can use Pictello as a tool for teaching behavioral expectations as well. It can also be used to reflect on a challenging event and communicate alternate ways for acting upon the situation.</p>\n<p>With Pictello, new activities and settings don\u2019t have to be a source of anxiety for kids and their parents. Instead, they can be transformed into valuable and rewarding learning opportunities (Core Drive #2, Development &amp; Accomplishment).</p>\n<h3>6. My PlayHome</h3>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qR0HR-wE6tE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Besides language, social and reciprocal interactions are also challenging for many kids on the autisic spectrum. In the past, therapists would manipulate simple pretend play toys and have their students passively model their actions. This, of course, does not feel like play to the child. Queue gamification to the rescue!</p>\n<p>My PlayHome uses the natural inclination that many autistic spectrum children have towards digital media to help them engage with others through contexts presented on the app. With some help from adults, these skills can be transitioned into more real life settings.</p>\n<h3>7. Word SLapPs</h3>\n<p><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/19ag9oHgu1g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>While flashcards are common teaching tools, they are not terribly engaging or interesting.</p>\n<p>Word SLapPs offers a new alternative to help autism spectrum children learn about household items, different foods, and even better remember and understand their friends and family. Images can be imported into the app and then accompanied by an audio recording, using the voice of an adult, or better yet, the child\u2019s own voice. This can include questions that the adult or teacher formulates.</p>\n<p>Programs can be customized to suit the unique needs of individual children. This is a great tool for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>helping kids build and develop expressive and receptive language skills</li>\n<li>being able to recognize people in their lives and use their name</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>8. ABA Find IT</h3>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nGsEPr3y938\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>ABA stands for Applied Behavioral Analysis. It is a conceptual framework used to shape new behaviors which consists of three components:</p>\n<p>(1) antecedent &#8211; the trigger for a specific behavior</p>\n<p>(2) targeted behavior</p>\n<p>(3) consequence or reward</p>\n<p>This framework can apply universally to many different settings and situations. However, it is used quite predominantly to help autistic kids learn new vocabulary, concepts, and even skills.</p>\n<p>In traditional therapy sessions, flashcards and 3D objects are used. For example, the teacher might lay out a simple array of plastic toys in front of the child and ask them to \u201ctouch the ball.\u201d (antecedent). If they respond correctly (behavior), they are given an appropriate reward (e.g. high five). As the child masters responses, they achieve a sense of Core Drive #2, Development &amp;&nbsp;Accomplishment which propels them to continue engaging and learning.</p>\n<p>ABA Find It uses multi-sensory features and evolving levels of complexity (including real life backgrounds) to help kids master new levels of skill. It turns identification lesson plans into an actual interactive game.</p>\n<h3>9. Puppet Pals</h3>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/FYUx7QVXXX4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>With this app, parents teachers and caregivers can turn the photos they take as valuable teaching tools. Real life social situations can be confusing for kids on the autistic spectrum. Actions and events can happen very quickly. And due to language difficulties, it can be difficult for adults to help kids reflect on situations to discuss better forms of behavior or language to use.</p>\n<p>The use of customized stories can be a powerful teaching tool. With Puppet Pals, photos of other kids, the child, adults etc. can be used (Core Drive #5, Social Influence &amp;&nbsp;Relatedness). Through the use of a recording feature, users can create voices for the puppets. The&nbsp;overall format can be enormously helpful for replaying situations and teaching alternate ways of behaving, communicating, or interacting.</p>\n<h3>10. Kid In Story</h3>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3FBj4jsRZoM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Many kids on the autistic spectrum are good at recognizing words and saying them out loud. However, they have much more difficulty with reading comprehension. Instead of regular story books, a better way to help them understand what is going on within a larger context, &nbsp;is to help the child create their own stories with themselves as the main character.</p>\n<p>The iPad camera can be used to photograph the child. The image can then be inserted into a story setting and the adult can use their voice to narrate what is happening. As an additional step, it may be helpful to transcribe the narration in writing. This can help the child learn how to become better at processing and understanding whole passages.</p>\n<h3>Gamification to Improve Lives for Autism Spectrum Children</h3>\n<p>With so many children now being diagnosed on the autism spectrum, the need for customizable teaching tools and individualized education is becoming increasingly important. Apps like the ones listed above can be truly fun and engaging while stimulating basic to advanced levels of learning and social development. These apps can help take some of the frustration and boredom out of learning routines and help autistic kids improve their functioning skills in an otherwise confusing and chaotic world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Is it time to upgrade yourself yet?</li><li>Learn 20 years of world class knowledge in a game from me in a gamified platform and make 2023 your biggest win.</li><li>Download my brain, level up your input, and watch your output transform your life!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><strong>Core Drive 3: Empower of Creativity &amp; Feedback</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The world is becoming more and more chaotic &#8211; just like the beginning of any hero&#8217;s journey!&nbsp;</li><li>Plan your own personal build strategy in OP, make the world your canvas, and express yourself fully in this world of chaos.</li><li>Imagine yourself 5 years from now. Do you like what you see? What if you imagine yourself learning all the knowledge, skill, and connections from Octalysis Prime. Would that be worth pursuing?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><strong>Core Drive 4: Ownership &amp; Possession</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When you get yourself to tiptop form, money is easy. You&#8217;ve already spent years accumulating valuable skills. You just need that last 10% to monetize it to the fullest.&nbsp;</li><li>Some of the knowledge I&#8217;m sharing on OP (like certain key principles in Behavioral Economics) singlehandedly helped me make $200K more, either because it helped secure a large client project, or was the key component that solved another challenging client project.</li><li>Money is a reflection of your skill growth and diligent no-procrastination work ethic, plus a bit of luck. Octalysis Prime can help you with the first, you have to pick up the second (or with a bit of gamifying), and we can only pray for the third.</li><li>If you are going to invest in ANYTHING in this volatile bear market, invest in yourself!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><strong>Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We are social animals that NEED respect from those around us. Gain respect by becoming the best you.</li><li>Gain appreciation from peers, family, and loved ones, by understanding how the social brain works.</li><li>Connect with a passionate community of innovators, educators, entrepreneurs, thinkers, storytellers just like you with the OP Slack Community.</li><li>No longer be the only crazy one in your community. Join the 19,071 Octalysis Prime Members and finally feel understood!</li><li>Observe social proof of all the OP Members who share their wins about becoming better teachers, raised millions of dollars, got recognized by their CEO, improved their company culture and product, and found their dream jobs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><strong>Core Drive 6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We only do these type of promotions 1-2 times a year, some make sure you don&#8217;t let the opportunity slip!</li><li>Every year you don&#8217;t upgrade yourself, you are letting valuable opportunities slip as life snowballs into compounding success. The earlier you start, the more exponential rewards you get..</li><li>You can wait for my&nbsp;next public workshops that costs $500-$1000/person, or you could get OP now for $250/yr and get everything I have done including a one-month Masterclass on Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design (we sold it for $1000/person in 2020).</li><li>3 Days Left to take advantage of this offer \ud83d\ude09</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><strong>Core Drive 7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Check out the world&#8217;s most impactful game &#8211; a game that helps you learn and apply behavioral science, gamification, parenting, entrepreneurship, fundraising, management, public speaking, and many more!&nbsp;</li><li>If you are curious about how Yu-kai Chou, regularly rated Number 1 Gamification Guru in the world, designs and creates his own gamified educational journey, then you should definitely become a member of Octalysis Prime!</li><li>Our DAU/MAU (Daily Active User divided by Monthly Active User) is above 30%. Curious about why so many people are coming back to OP on a DAILY Basis?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><strong>Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Feeling stuck? More knowledge can get you unstuck.</li><li>Feeling worried? More emotional mastery could get you out of worrying.</li><li>Feeling anxious? A changing world offers more opportunities to leap ahead.</li><li>Feeling excited? Become OP and the world is your oyster!</li><li>The changing world and economy might\u00a0collapse on us soon. Are you fully prepared to tackle all that is coming and surf it like a wave?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>See you in <a href=\"http://octalysisprime.com\">Octalysis Prime!</a> </p>\n",

Those opportunities at your doorstep that you might regret 30 years later for not taking?<br /><br />As an esteemed author that <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sold over 100K books</a> and a handful of billionaire readers &#8211; as well as a designer that has <a href=\"http://octalysisgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">empowered over 1 Billion user experiences</a> &#8211; I certainly had no shortage of exciting opportunities&nbsp;in my life (a couple of them nation-changing).<br /><br />But when my long-time friend&nbsp;from Google, Jun Loayza, reached out to me about this <a href=\"http://metablox.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Metablox Concept</a>, I&nbsp;felt this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and immediately jumped on it.<br /><br />So, is this the opportunity that will make&nbsp;you rich in 4 months? NO&nbsp;&#8211; if that&#8217;s what you want Metablox is not what you are looking for.<br /><br /><strong>This is an opportunity to be part of an ecosystem to preserve humanity&#8217;s most important memories onto the blockchain</strong>, so they don&#8217;t live on a single server like Google Photos/Drive or Dropbox.&nbsp;<br /><br />It&#8217;s an opportunity to turn every location in the real world into a historical site or a museum so our important memories will carry on to <strong>generations</strong> to come.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Minting on May 23rd 6AM Pacific (less than 18&nbsp;hours away)</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>After 6 months of extraordinarily-hard work, including building a full game mechanics platform and becoming officials partners with Polygon, we are finally ready to launch our <a href=\"http://metablox.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Metablox Minting</a> tomorrow for San Francisco and Miami &#8211; with Singapore and New York coming shortly after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minting can be done with Debit Card (recommended for those who don&#8217;t have Crypto/MetaMask experience) or MATIC/Polygon via MetaMask (for more advanced users)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel that <strong>at some point in your life you might want to own Metablox NFT</strong>, here are a few reasons why reserving Blox on our platform before our minting begins would be a pretty smart thing to do:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Reserving a Blox ensures that the location you care about (meaning) or with high growth potential (value) cannot be taken by anyone else within 48 hours of minting. It would just be yours alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) Reserving a Blox ensures that the mint price will always be Phase 1 pricing. In our game mechanics, <strong>every 10% ownership of a city, the mint price will increase by 50%</strong>. But for the property you have reserved , it will always be the base lowest price ($100-$300 per Blox depending on Tier). Even if you missed your reservation, you might still want to mint on Day 1 because after a few days minting could become 150% ^ x higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3) Reserving a Blox actually will earn an additional 50% discount off the base lowest price. Due to the recent decrease of the crypto market, to show appreciation for our reservations holders that have been with us since January, we decided to cut all minting for reservation holders by half to factor in potential weaker buying power. This means the $100-$300 per Blox will decrease to $50-$150 ONLY for those who reserved a Blox before the minting 18 hours from now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only catch here is that each person can only mint 3 Blox before the normal mint phase begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br />Influencers resonate with our mission</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Metablox is all about preserving meaningful memories to a location (Blox NFT) forever on the blockchain.

Learning is one of our most fundamental activities. In fact, when things become too easy and no more learning opportunities are there, it becomes boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/images.surferseo.art/a39c2584-601c-41a6-b9ae-74fd5f0a1018.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Playing Games become boring when you can't learn how to improve, like Tic-Tac-Toe\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t like to learn from long lectures or huge paragraphs of text.

If they succeed, we are happy for them. But when they fail, our brains take special notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is likely why we think it&#8217;s funny when people something stupid and hurt themselves &#8211; our brains want us to take special attention to this event by making it pleasurable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We would even want to tell this #fail activity to our friends so we could all laugh at it. It&#8217;s not just about being morbid, it is a survival trait that uses joy to spread important lessons (much like gamification and learning with games)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3) <strong>They learn from Stories</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when we are listening through long monologues, we feel immersed when it is in story form, with people we care about, and events that surprise us. Think about times when people in a village sit around the campfire and listen to the elder talk about experiences and adventures he had in his youth. Our brains are fully engaged, and we likely learning all the lessons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The relevance of of Educational Games</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the 3 ways our brains like to learn. But what shook up the system is that the things we have to learn in the past century became dramatically more complex &#8211; things like advanced mathematics, philosophy etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the technology to deliver the education was always stuck at the same place &#8211; we rely on pen and paper, and to some extent powerpoint. And therefore, the tools we have failed at engaging our brains to learn the most important things in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where educational games and learning games come in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The opportunity of Learning Games</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of new gaming technology, for the first time in history, students can now learn through</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) Trial &amp; Error by playing and replaying through the game</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) Watch other students and players play the game and learn from that</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3) Instead of listening to a story, they actually become part of the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is why Educational Games are so impactful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays you will find a variety of stellar learning games and educational games for every grade level that teaches all sorts of topics in a classroom, including math, science, research, writing, and language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helps educators and students grown and learn in schools and classrooms. Some even help engage parents to become of the interplay between the teachers and the children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No longer would kids need to deal with boring school skills and tests, but students become excited through the gamified class that now involves teamwork and gameplay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every classroom can now help students through learning from games and math to achieve maximum fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help them become excited in school, while succeed in the fields of math, science, language, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Educational games and learning games makes learning amazing for teachers and students alike.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to progress in our skills, free our knowledge, focus on distance learning, and support our assignments and scores, educational games are definitely the best way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the big question is what Educational games to use and discover, so that students and teachers can both growth and have fun together while improving their skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that, check out my others posts, such as <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-examples/top-ten-learning-games-kids/\">Top Ten Learning Games For Kids</a>.</p>\n",

(Yes, there are a group of gamers online that heavily use excel spreadsheets to play games better.)</p>\n<p>When a game or a product can get users to voluntarily pull excel out and figure out how to optimize your performance, I would say it does this Core Drive pretty successfully.</p>\n<p>My favorite crowdsource example has been Foldit, where a 15-Year AIDS problem was solved within 10 days.</p>\n<p>Even in the work place, when you empower your workers to utilize their creativity and see feedback quickly, you have engaged workers.</p>\n<p>Many corporate workers have talked to me before about being an entrepreneur simply because it&#8217;s frustrating seeing feedback for their ideas 10 months after proposing it through the bureaucratic situation.</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s 20% time allowed employees to express their creativity through other projects and see results quickly.</p>\n<p>When utilizing Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback, it is important to note a few things:</p>\n<p>There must be a balance between the learning curve and the challenge. If something is too hard, players withdraw or get anxiety. If it is too boring, players feel bored and leave. A good gamification (and game) designer needs to make sure the flow for Core Drive 3 is well aligned to maximize engagement.</p>\n<h3>Boosters</h3>\n<p>A good way to add Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback into a design is through what I call Boosters (#31), basically things that make progress easier.</p>\n<p>The reason why boosters are effective is because players now have to plan what type of boosters to obtain through what activities.</p>\n<p>An example of this is when users are accumulating &#8220;points&#8221; on a site, but when the site offers special items or &#8220;knowledge scores&#8221; that can superboost points acquisition, users start to plan out how to obtain the right items or jnowledge to fulfill their objective better.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s always good to incorporate as many core drives into a design as possible. Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback is great because it gets users to discover their creative beings, inspires people, and can become evergreen mechanics that keep the users engaged for long periods of time.</p>\n",

The design of the app is very minimalistic, so Thorsten took on the challenge of making the experience more engaging while keeping the design slim.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-slideshare wp-block-embed-slideshare wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Octalysis Level 1 Certificate - Thorsten Niemeyer - AnkiDroid\" src=\"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/wlMvGkzQhAK584\" width=\"427\" height=\"356\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"> <strong> <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/fdlink/octalysis-level-1-certificate-thorsten-niemeyer-ankidroid\" title=\"Octalysis Level 1 Certificate - Thorsten Niemeyer - AnkiDroid\" target=\"_blank\">Octalysis Level 1 Certificate &#8211; Thorsten Niemeyer &#8211; AnkiDroid</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/fdlink\" target=\"_blank\">Yu-kai Chou (yukai@yukaichou.com)</a></strong> </div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Thank you very much for your extensive and valuable feedback and the certification!

The main learning opportunity is a one-day face-to-face employee engagement programme, open to all of the organisation\u2019s 230,000 employees globally. A smaller number of employees are given kits to take away with them to continue testing their own chosen waterbody and uploading data for the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were impressed with the overall quality of Sarah&#8217;s submission. She absorbed the knowledge of Yu-kai&#8217;s Behavioral Design Masterclass very well and managed to obtain an Octalysis Certificate on her first attempt!

Both in <em>explicit gamification</em> (where the user acknowledges they are playing a game), and in <em>implicit gamification</em> (a design that subtly employs gamification techniques into the user experience).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common mistake made when designing a Leaderboard, is creating a basic leaderboard. These leaderboards show where the user ranks in a list from the first to the last place. Such leaderboards do motivate, the top 5-10% will compete with each other and often times work hard to climb higher. However, the mid and bottom tier will usually feel demoralized, as they feel there is no point in even trying to reach the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Urgent Optimism &#8211; Why You Need It</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A leaderboard should make all your users feel <em>urgent optimism</em>. This term is from Jane McGonigal (watch her <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world/transcript\" target=\"_blank\">TED talk</a>). Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately&nbsp;to tackle an obstacle, combined with the belief&nbsp;of having a reasonable shot of success.<br />When you have many users on a leaderboard, most users will perceive their rank as meaningless, even if it is a high rank percentage-wise. (E.g. rank 582 out of 6,024 is percentage-wise impressive (top 10%), but it does not feel like an accomplishment.) In this scenario, you can choose to only show your users their percentile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user should feel that if they try, they can reach the win-state, and that there is urgency so they feel they have to act now. If a user sees that they have 500 points, but the users in the top ten all have 1,000,000 or more points, they are not motivated, they are demoralized. The user will feel like they can never catch up (no urgent optimism) and will give up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Leaderboard Designs That Do Work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Micro leaderboards</strong> show the ranking of the user in their <em>region</em>, or among their friends (a <em>social</em> leaderboard). These kinds of design will instil a sense of <em>optimism</em> (the user can try and will then have a reasonable chance to reach the top of the leaderboard) as well as a sense of <em>urgency</em> (how can I lose from my mother?).<br /><br />Make sure your leaderboards are <strong>refreshing</strong>. If a leaderboard exists for a longer period of time, new users who are just starting will feel overwhelmed as they are not able to catch up and will give up.<br /><br />The top ten users like their status, so show their names. But don&#8217;t show their statistics as to not demoralize other users. Instead, only show the statistics of the user herself and the 5 users above and below her.<br /><br />The thing that really matters, is that the user is motivated to climb higher than those above her on the leaderboard (win-state), and not let those below her catch up.</p>\n\n\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjsutshair.online%2Fbehavioral-design%2Fpoints-badges-leaderboards-part-3-of-3%2F&#038;text=When%20designing%20Leaderboards%2C%20make%20sure%20your%20users%20only%20see%20what%20is%20meaningful%20to%20them.&#038;via=yukaichou&#038;related=yukaichou' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">When designing Leaderboards, make sure your users only see what is meaningful to them. </a></span><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjsutshair.online%2Fbehavioral-design%2Fpoints-badges-leaderboards-part-3-of-3%2F&#038;text=When%20designing%20Leaderboards%2C%20make%20sure%20your%20users%20only%20see%20what%20is%20meaningful%20to%20them.&#038;via=yukaichou&#038;related=yukaichou' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n\n\n<p><br /><em>Got a taste of the things you will learn in&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://octalysisprime.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Octalysis Prime</a>?

The term &#8216;badge&#8217; is overused, and there are better names: achievements, icons, iconic figures&#8230;<br /><br />Achievement symbols can also be 3 stars systems, a uniform change, belts in martial arts, certificates. <em>They symbolize accomplishment.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are Badges overused?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many companies like to put badges on experiences because they only see the shallow side of the game. A game is supposedly designed to have a fun and exciting gameplay. As you play this exciting game, you want to strive for certain milestones (that not everybody can achieve). If you hit them, you want to get recognized, brag about it, or feel good about yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of gamified experiences and products make the user do a boring thing for 20 or a thousand times, and reward this with a badge. Unless the achievement is &#8216;persistence&#8217;, this does not make much sense.<br /><br />Do not make an achievement more special than it is supposed to be.<br /><em>Instead</em>, create a fun experience, with the Right-Brain Core Drives (Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback, Social Influence &amp; Relatedness, Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity).  If people then uniquely use their creativity or their skill set to do something that others can not or will not do, symbolize this achievement. Reward them on top of the already fun game. The user will be proud of it, feel excited about it, and might even brag about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Core Drives</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Badges focus most on Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment.<br /><br />Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling &#8211; If the Achievement Symbol ties to something greater, you&#8217;re an evangelist, save lives, plant threes. If the user actually made a difference in the world, they wil feel proud of it.<br /><br />Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback &#8211; Badges that require creativity and problem solving.<br /><br />Core Drive 4: Ownership &amp; Possession &#8211; Badges can be turned into a collection set, a collectable theme.<br /><br />Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness &#8211; E.g. when everyone who has the achievement can interact with each other, but if you don\u2019t you can\u2019t. You want to get in the club to mingle with those who also did amazing things. Or rewarding generosity, reaching our and helping other people.<br /><br />Core Drive 6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience &#8211;  Badges can be made very scarce, but well-known. Dangling in front of the user who knows what to do to get it (Earned Lunch GT #7) and they want to grind and do it.<br /><br />Core Drive 7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity &#8211; Badges can be stealthily released as an easter egg badge.<br /><br />Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance &#8211; Achievement symbols that can be lost if you mess up. Keep in mind that you don\u2019t want to make the user so nervous to lose their achievement symbol that they\u2019re Black Hat motivated.<br /><br />At the <strong>core</strong> of Achievement Symbols is Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The <strong>one rule</strong> for whether a badge is meaningful or not: If you give it to people, how likely are they to share it and brag about it to other people?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implement Badges Correctly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing an experience, keep the <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/the-strategy-dashboard-for-gamification-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Strategy Dashboard</a> in mind.

This is where The Big Burn (GT #88) can be used by introducing a very expensive item that will only give a small cosmetic change. The user can tell other users about her succes in coins accumulation by showing off this cosmetic change. This mechanic, where the user can quickly burn the majority of her points for something, helps you to control your economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Exchangeable Points the user can redeem points for items that have a <em>one-time use</em>.

He tackles the question using the <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\">Eight Core Drives</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPeople often focus on what they want to achieve; outcomes in a limited time frame. This is mostly based on <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/white-hat-black-hat-gamification-octalysis-framework/\">Black Hat</a> and Extrinsic Core Drives (CD). Namely <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-loss-and-avoidance/\">CD8: Avoidance</a>, <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-6-scarcity-impatience/\">CD6: Scarcity</a>, and <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-2-development-accomplishment/\">CD2: Accomplishment</a>. As a result they either burn out, or they stop due to a lack of urgency as soon as the time frame is finished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s useful to leverage CD8, CD6, and CD2 at first to create the urgency to start building the habit. But to enrich the experience and sustain the behavior, we should add the intrinsic Core Drives <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-3-empowerment-creativity-feedback/\">CD3: Empowerment</a>, <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/the-8-core-drives-of-gamification-7-unpredictability/\">CD7: Curiosity</a> and <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-of-gamification-5-social-influence-relatedness/\">CD5: Social Influence.</a> A CD5 example would be having an accountability partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think the crucial Core Drive at play is actually <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-4-ownership-possession/\">CD4: Ownership</a>. By repeating an action every day,&nbsp;unconsciously, we create a&nbsp;new identity&nbsp;(CD4). We don&#8217;t want to lose this identity (CD8), so the habit persists. As part of our identity, it&#8217;s becoming easier to sustain the behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, my identity is centered around being a badminton player. If I had to stop playing after 20 years of practice, I&#8217;d likely go through an identity crisis.\f&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Habit Building &#8211; Reply from Bo Ullersted</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blogpost-Profile-Picture-3.png?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Monday's Mini Habit Building - Profile Picture 3\" class=\"wp-image-16011\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" title=\"Habit Building Reply Bu Ullersted - Profile Picture\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blogpost-Profile-Picture-3.png?w=512&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blogpost-Profile-Picture-3.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blogpost-Profile-Picture-3.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bo is a teacher from Denmark and a long-time Octalysis Prime member with a steady record of great quality replies. Here he connects B.J. Fogg\u2019s Behavioral Model and Daniel Kahneman\u2019s System 1 and System 2 thinking to the question:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s part of the B=MAP theory: when it becomes a habit, you automatically have a Prompt &#8211; you remember that this is the time you usually do this activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also increases your Ability to do the action. For this reason, less Motivation is needed to do the action.&nbsp;Yu-kai even states that when something is a strong habit, motivation is needed to&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;do the action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why does our Ability increase when we build a habit? It has to do with System 1 and 2, from \u2018Thinking, fast and Slow\u2019. When we do stuff that are not habits, we need to spend mental energy on activating the \u2018logical brain\u2019, System 2. But habits can be run by our efficient, &#8220;intuitive brain&#8221;, System 1, which is our default mode.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Join the Discussion!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to join a community of learners and bring your knowledge of Human-Focused Design to the next level?<br />Don&#8217;t hesitate to try out <a href=\"https://join.octalysisprime.com/op-fr/\">Octalysis Prime</a> for free!</p>\n",

Crowdsourcing has been used to solicit, improve, and address complex virtual and real-world challenges. Some of these applications are in the areas of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Innovation and creativity</li>\n<li>Building accurate and vast knowledge</li>\n<li>Solving complex multi-layered problems</li>\n<li>Achieving complicated feats within a short span of time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Crowdsourcing utilizes several core behavioral drives that compel users to collectively work together to solve problems (sometimes by breaking them into tedious, and manageable tasks). Wikipedia is one example of a crowdsource information platform that utilizes gamification principles to entice users to curate and publish regular content while holding the community (and its content) responsible for accuracy and quality.</p>\n<p>While different crowdsourcing application utilize a wide-range of gamification principles at varying degrees (and with differing success), the decision to implement gamification mechanics depends on the quality of experience the project seeks to offer based on the understanding of their users&#8217; drives and motivations.</p>\n<p>In some cases, people may be naturally inspired to contribute their time and efforts towards a particular cause (e.g. Wikipedia). In other instances, it may be beneficial to enhance the experience of the crowdsourced endeavor by making it more immersive and compelling through the integration of key game mechanics.</p>\n<p>Here are several examples (in no particular order) which highlight the achievement of large scale or complex feats through the integration of gamification and crowdsourcing.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><b>Tomnod</b></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/PGLbowF_JRQ\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Tomnod is a digital initiative which uses high-definition images taken by Digital Globe satellites to pinpoint objects and places in the aftermath of natural disasters and man-made catastrophes. Their most recent search (launched in March) is focused on finding the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, flight MH370, in the Indian Ocean.</p>\n<p>Participants are asked to tag various areas of a map to identify possible clues such as rafts, slicks, and wreckages. A crowdranked algorithm then filters out the most promising leads based on map locations that have been tagged by multiple players. This indicates a high concentration of wreckage which may lead to finding the potential location of the plane.</p>\n<p>This initiative has been extremely populer: The map has generated over 257 million views, over 2.9 million areas on the map have been tagged by players, and over 3 million people have actively participated in the search.</p>\n<p>Tomnod is highly driven by Core Drive #1, Epic Meaning &amp; Calling because as a participant, you are engaged in an actual real-life mission of critical importance.\u00a0 Therefore, the simple (and at times tedious) act of tagging and identifying objects becomes quite intriguing and naturally compelling given the mission of the search. Core Drive #5, Social Influence &amp; Relatedness, is also in play as you want to positively identify tags which, combined with other positive I.D.s, gets picked up by the algorithm. And the satisfaction of securing a high number of completed tasks is driven by Core Drive #2, Development &amp; Accomplishment, as well as Core Drive #3, Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback.</p>\n<h3><b>Play to Cure: Genes in Space</b></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CeEDAchrc1U\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>As you all are probably aware by now, DNA contains coding instructions for building the protein structures in our bodies. Certain deviations in these sequences result in malformed units which can ultimately contribute to cancer.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the identification of these anomalies is quite important. Yet, scientists do not have the resources to map all of these out. However, it is possible to assist with this endeavor by playing &#8220;Genes in Space&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The storyline is set in space (in case that wasn&#8217;t obvious yet). Players need to collect genetic data pertinent to the formation of cancer. Within the game, this is a substance called &#8220;alpha&#8221;. As this is collected, the players are empowered to shoot asteroids and reach the next level by upgrading their space ship to become even more powerful and therefore successful at breaking up the asteroids..</p>\n<p>Gathering &#8220;alpha&#8221; along the plotted course is the gamified shell of the actual task of identifying faults in real gene data. Genetic information of countless tumors is integrated within the game and so as you progress, you are actually crowdsource participating in important cancer research!</p>\n<p>Besides playing for a greater cause (Epic Meaning &amp; Calling), the game is also propelled by Development &amp; Accomplishment because as more &#8220;alpha&#8221; is collected, players are empowered to hit more asteroids and move up in ranking (Social Influence &amp; Relatedness)</p>\n<h3><b>The Great Brain Experiment</b></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/FeHrHVQziZ4\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>In traditional brain and psychology research, participants are subjected to controlled scenarios and research data is gathered from their various responses. However, in order for scientists to form reliable conclusions, they need to collect information from large and sometimes highly unique and/or varied populations, a difficult feat to say the least. Fortunately, this challenge can be met through crowdsourcing administering tasks using a digital app game.</p>\n<p>The Great Brain Experiment was developed at the Trust Centre for Neuroimaging in London. Players hardly realize that they are contributing to scientific research as they engage in fun games. Targets of their current studies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Risk taking</li>\n<li>Memory</li>\n<li>Impulsivity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Newer games will be focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making predictions given a certain amount of information</li>\n<li>Decision making</li>\n<li>Hearing abilities</li>\n<li>Performance under pressured situations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is somewhat unique about this game is that it is not intended to compel players towards higher levels of performance (Development &amp; Accomplishment). After all, researchers are primarily interested in how people react and behave under normal circumstances.</p>\n<p>Although they are playing to contribute to scientific understanding (Epic Meaning &amp; Calling), the actual experience is driven by other factors. A key element of the game is relative scoring. Players are given scores as percentiles of the larger group. For example, they might be told that they have better impulse controlled compared to 90% of the population. High percentile scores elicit feelings of empowerment (Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback) as players are given immediate feedback that they possess skills or abilities that are greater than the average person, a clear example of Core Drive#5, Social Influence &amp; Relatedness.</p>\n<h3><b>Google Image Labeler</b><b>\u00a0</b></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/yWZUxnRYISs\" height=\"315\" width=\"420\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Google Image Labeler was a rather early example of a crowd sourced game. It was launched back in 2006 when Google was seeking to improve the accuracy of its image database.\u00a0 They wanted to make sure that the images which came up during searches on Google Images were the most relevant to user queries.</p>\n<p>To achieve this massive undertaking, the company decided to integrate this task into a game whose structure was based on the original ESP game (an idea in computer science\u00a0for addressing the problem of creating difficult metadata- effectively the original concept behind crowdsourcing).</p>\n<p>Participants were each paired with a partner online. Each was shown an image and asked to generate as many labels as possible. The partners were awarded points when their labels matched.</p>\n<p>This game is largely driven by social influence (Core Drive #5), even though players were connected to just one other person (i.e. partner).</p>\n<h3><b>Foldit</b></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/JdBcpdH_ptA\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Scientists understand how proteins are made from different amino acid sequences. However, in order to generate treatments and other types of solutions, they need to have a clear visual understanding of how proteins unfold to become 3D structures.</p>\n<p>Researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s Center for Game Science turned the study of protein folding into a game called Foldit.</p>\n<p>Each player is given a basic structure which they can then manipulate. One participant likened the experience to a 3D version of Tetris, where the objective is to make certain components fill an empty space.</p>\n<p>So far, Foldit has enabled two major forms of scientific achievement</p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer Monkey virus which causes AIDS. This took place in a matter of three weeks. But it was an issue that confounded researchers for fifteen years.</p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Redesigning the protein which catalyzes the Diels-Alder reaction which is used in synthetic chemistry. Players came up with a version where 13 amino acids were added. This addition increased the enzyme\u2019s efficiency by eighteen times.</p>\n<p>The motivation for this game is propelled by White Hat core drives:</p>\n<p>1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Epic Meaning &amp; Calling where participation can lead to momentous scientific advancements</p>\n<p>2) \u00a0 \u00a0 Development &amp; Accomplishment from being able to unravel protein structures and even improve upon existing ones</p>\n<p>3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback, where the overall experience is like solving a puzzle by coming up with different possibilities. Scores are awarded for how well the protein is folded.</p>\n<p>4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ownership &amp; Possession. Players are able to feel a sense of pride in the structures they have generated. They are even able to share their expertise in groups</p>\n<p>5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Social Influence &amp;\u00a0Relatedness. Participants are rewarded for the ability to fold proteins. And this generates competition among the players which provides additional motivation to come up with innovative solutions.</p>\n<p>From these examples, it is clear that crowdsourcing has enormous potential to achieve the seemingly impossible. The implementation of game mechanics fuels greater participation leading to the ultimate accomplishment of large scale and far reaching objectives. As marvelous new breakthroughs are made possible through crowd sourced initiatives, the power of connection and collaboration is increasingly being realized as a fundamental tool and not just an idealistic philosophy.</p>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How bad is the Covid-19 Corona Virus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are two issues to consider here:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) virus/health/quanantine (natural disaster)<br />2) lockdown/economy/social unrest (man-caused issue)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For (1) the question is how bad is it and are the human actions overreacting. If you look at this graph, if countries don\u2019t take extreme measures, it grows radically fast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the underreporting I think things are way worse than it is (many places even if you have symptoms you can\u2019t get tested due to resources. A governor in Mexico said that the data shows confirmed cases only have rich people and therefore poor people aren\u2019t at risk, without thinking it may be that only rich people can get tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there is an issue with people comparing historical disaster numbers (that have ended) with CURRENT COVID damage (oh look, this historical thing was 12x worse). But COVID is still doubling every few days and we might just be seeing the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, counting deaths to confirmed cases is also an illusion because based on exponential growth, the deaths today are from the much smaller population of confirmed cases a few weeks ago, so match with the denominator of TODAY it appears small. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps an interesting comparison would be with \u201cresolved\u201d cases, namely deaths vs recovered ratios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many regions show numbers closer to 1 death for every 2 recovered people.All this is to say, don\u2019t underestimate it please. The power of exponential curves means that in one day it could cover more ground than the whole previous month. It\u2019s a life or death situation that should be treated seriously. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yea, we lose a lot of freedom, but if each person has an invisible fused bomb on him/her, I\u2019m sure we would agree losing that freedom temporarily until the bomb threat is resolved would be a prudent move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most nations are doubling between 2 to 10 days. Some people say that our lockdown measures are like an elephant getting attacked by a house cat, and in panic, jumped off a cliff (the reaction was more dangerous than the threat). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, look at New York. New York was a \u201ccalm elephant\u201d that didn\u2019t take strong measures until much later,\u00a0and now it\u2019s the new Wuhan with some describing it as an apocalyptic war zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there is a lot of different info out there and perspectives, but for you and your own family I would urge you to be cautious. I already know over a dozen people in my own personal network (none of them Asian) who have COVID. It\u2019s pretty bad and doesn\u2019t just effect the elderly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you recover it could leave permanent lung damage.<br />No need to panic, but take cautious steps. Having a calm mind with active (and cleanly washed) hands is good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an estimation that if no or late extreme measures happening, this will end up with about 10 &#8211; 50 Million deaths worldwide. The range is pretty large and I believe in it (IF countries and people continue to act the way they are). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that effect, locking down economies and the DEVASTATING impact MAY be still worth it. Which leads us to (2)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(2) The human-caused economic crisis due to a lockdown\u2026I think would be way worse than previous recessions. Previous recessions were usually about the financial \u201celite\u201d (as a convenient word but not saying they are better) using too much leverage and suffering: bankers, financial firms, investors, technologists, even home owners. But the foundational economy could still run pretty well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waiters, cashiers, and factory workers were obviously indirectly impacted but still made money and spent it at grocery stores. The financial \u201celite\u201d later on uses this foundation to build back their wealth.This time around the foundational economy is being wiped. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most restaurants, manufacturers, airlines would go bankrupt in 2-3 months of this lockdown (which is why the US Gov approved $2 Trillion to try to keep them alive). I think this would lead to massive unemployment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case in point, Nevada\u2019s historical high in unemployment/week was 8,945 in 2009. A couple weeks ago their unemployment claim was 92,300.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just for the last week of April, California received 533,568 unemployment claims. I still think this is still just the beginning of the iceberg (unfortunately\u2026) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this MASSIVE amount of unemployment, there is going to be social unrest, desperation, racial aggression and more. It is for this reason why I left the US as this would not be good for my twin daughters Symphony and Harmony. (Taiwan has a stable society and I believe the worst is already over here).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So onto the (semi) good news:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Post-Covid Resistance: Beginning of the Heroes Journey.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe the virus issue will be dealt with in 2-8 months. I believe the economic issue would last for 3-5 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But during this time there is a huge reshuffling too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Political structures, power and influence distribution, old way of doing things &#8211; all this stuff would be shuffled up.In stable times, a lot of things are locked up in Ice and move extremely slowly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In chaotic times, things become fluid like water (before they stabilize and becomes Ice again). This means that better than any time in history, we are able to hustle and strategically position ourselves to make an impact in the Post-COVID world, replace broken systems in the old world, and achieve things that were never possible before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my mind this is like after the Terminator Judgment Day, the remaining humans (who were NOT in power nor respected prior) need to come together and protect humanity against new threats (hmm\u2026like AI-powered robots taking over).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least for myself, this new sense of purpose at least fills me with hope and drive (instead of just doomsday survival mentality). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I immediately think about 100 things I need to do to make this positioning happen for myself during this 3-5 year reshuffling period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I plan to share this journey with everyone in hopes more people get inspired and join me on this too.Of course, if I&#8217;m the only person passionate about this, I would still do it as it is providing me many benefits. I just hope more people can be on this journey with me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can be part of the Post-Covid Resistance together.</p>\n",

There is a 3-5 year period to hustle and strategically position ourselves to create positive impact in this world.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 17th, the moment we heard that our city in the San Francisco Bay Area will start to go through a stay-home quarantine in midnight, we bought a one-way ticket for the whole family to fly to Taiwan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We literally had two hours to pack out of the blue, and could only bring the essentials  for a trip that could be anywhere between 3-8 months. Usually it takes two hours to pack for a one-day trip for my twin daughters, but this time it was like escaping an army of plague. We only grabbed what we needed to survive the plane flight, and planned to figure out where to live and what to wear after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan was one of the first countries to get hit by COVID-19, as every week there were 150,000 people commuting between Taiwan and China. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Taiwan managed it very well and so far has only experienced 3 deaths to date. When we left the US on the 17th we believe (and still believe) the worst was yet to come. In Taiwan we believe the worst is already over (these 2 weeks due to a mass reverse-exodus of people like me, Taiwan\u2019s cases jumped from 50ish to 300ish with deaths 2 and 3 during this time too, but it is not the fault of Taiwan operations and they still handle things very well as will explain below). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Taiwan is very aggressive in testing people so the numbers should be exhaustive (as opposed to many countries saying you have symptoms would not get you treated if you did not travel). Even after the virus wave, I believe there will be so many/much bankruptcies, unemployment, social unrest, and aggression towards Asians that it wouldn\u2019t be an ideal place to stay for my daughters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here\u2019s what Taiwan is doing: </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All foreign returns including myself are self-manage quarantined for 14 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Taiwan stand out is that my neighborhood head (like mayor but for the neighborhood) calls around 2-3 times a day to make sure my family is staying home and feeling well (we get individual calls for each individual in the family). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CDC also texts us daily to make sure we are feeling well, and if not, responding to the text would trigger a special vehicle to take us to the hospital (many global cases were results from Taxi rides to the hospitals). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even at home, I\u2019m supposed to be wearing a face mask at all times to make sure other family members are not affected (btw, since most sick people don\u2019t know they are sick, saying you should only wear masks if you are sick is not useful). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Taiwanese government also provides some money for each day of self-quarantine to ease economic impact or get a helper to buy food for individuals etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week they even sent a full police force to bust into nightclubs, Karaokes, and markets proactively to escort violators back home and fine them $3K &#8211; $30K USD which is substantial for a Taiwanese salary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, the people who are fined huge amounts are not confirmed cases, just foreigners returning from risky areas are supposed to be quarantined. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government is taking no chances of this breaking out. Everyone is afraid of the chink in the armor for the national defense and is preventing that outbreak in all means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s also unique is that each sick person has a unique number. So everyday in the news we will see statements like, \u201cWe now know #25 transmitted to #36 as they were attending the same school in the UK. #43 recovered and returned home from the hospital last Tuesday but a follow up check shows that she seems to be getting worse again.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why despite being the inconvenienced quarantine foreign returns, I feel much safer and better being here in Taiwan than anywhere else in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This whole experience became a prelude for me to think about the Post-COVID Resistance, which I will talk about in another post.</p>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Octalysis at Work</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Applying the Gamification Framework to Real-world Business Challenges</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Commentary By Gal Rimon, Founder &amp; CEO of <a href=\"https://centrical.com/platform/gamification/\">Centrical (formerly GamEffective)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in my career, I was deeply involved in Business Intelligence (BI). It occurred to me that BI is really good at determining what an organization should do next but offered no insight into those who\u2019d do the work, the employees. That realization drove me to form the company I lead today, Centrical. Its aim is to help enterprises help their employees get better at what they do and make it fun in the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the fun element, it should not be surprising that advanced gamification is at the core of our technology platform which holistically blends it with personalized microlearning, and real-time performance management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the course of researching effective ways to apply game mechanics to a range of employee performance challenges, I came upon the work of Yu-kai Chou and, specifically, his gamification framework, Octalysis. I was struck by how it provided a problem-solution construct to identify the sort of game, or motivational device, needed to address a particular real-world business challenge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eight core drivers that make up the Octalysis are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</li><li>Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment</li><li>Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback </li><li>Core Drive 4: Ownership &amp; Possession </li><li>Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness</li><li>Core Drive 6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience</li><li>Core Drive 7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity</li><li>Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In the years since 2013, when the company was founded, we\u2019ve developed gamification-centric solutions that touch on the core drives in the Octalysis framework for companies like Microsoft, Novartis, Synchrony Financial, and Unilever, among others. Here is a summary of that work and how it\u2019s been applied to help our customers\u2019 employees perform at their best.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"356\" height=\"710\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.47.58.png?resize=356%2C710&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15323\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Our first and most popular game mechanic is Narratives.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first and most popular game mechanic is narratives. They take the form of races, involving cars, boats and mountain climbing. Yes, in our game you can run up Mount Everest. A number of our customers operate contact centers where literally thousands of employees field queries from customers. It\u2019s tough work. Often in the last hour of a shift employees are drained. The centers handling Microsoft\u2019s Consumer Support Operations wanted their service agents to make or take just one more call. We implemented a narrative game that gave employees a reason to make the effort. More than boosting sales, research among these employees found, as a result of the game, they felt they were part of something greater than themselves, and, importantly, their work made a difference. That\u2019s what the core drive Epic Meaning &amp; Calling is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1150\" height=\"696\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.51.28.png?resize=1150%2C696&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15325\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This drive is associated with some tried-and-true game tools. Points, badges and leaderboards head that list. The old PBL\u2019s will still work. But with a decidedly Millennial workforce, adjustments and additions are called for in today\u2019s workplace. The leaderboards we create for customers are designed for maximum interactivity and filtering by each employee/user. Further, we leverage companies\u2019 internal video networks and messaging platforms to showcase the leaderboard in a kind of overtly public manner to please top-performers and prompt others to greater levels. We also include a Kudos feature, a variation on what Yu-kai refers to as High Five. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effect is the person getting the kudos feels a sense of accomplishment and recognition on top of Social Appreciation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1241\" height=\"749\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.52.07.png?resize=1241%2C749&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15326\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>The leaderboards we create for customers are designed for maximum interactivity.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve found that if we leave a gamification effort to PBLs only, engagement will drop; employees will stop looking at the boards because, more than losing interest, there\u2019s no compelling reason to look. In this case, changing things up a bit, as simple as that may sound, makes a big difference in participation continuity.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"418\" height=\"833\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.52.40.png?resize=418%2C833&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15327\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Drive 3: <strong>Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even people who perform repetitive tasks will contend with creative problem solving, the very essence of this core drive. Interestingly, we\u2019ve found many businesses need a number of ways to push this button in the hearts and minds of their employees. As it so happens, we offer game-driven features that relate directly to this core driver. Of note is our real-time feedback. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"412\" height=\"820\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.59.48.png?resize=412%2C820&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15333\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Boosters urge an employee to<br /> keep up the good work or work<br /> a bit harder &#8211; always in a<br /> positive, motivational manner</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When employees wonder how they\u2019re doing, they want to know now. A retroactive assessment can actually be a demotivator and, consequently, create a manager-employee relationship problem. Millennials look to their managers as coaches, people who can help improve their skills. If their 1:1 sessions are about stuff in the faded past, coaching can\u2019t happen; confrontation will. Along with that capability, we offer manager messaging, allowing communications with individual team members or the entire group; another way of offering feedback based on need or urgency. Our platform also allows personalized messages to be sent to employees on an automated basis. Consider getting a notification that includes a reminder of a due date but also a digital pat on the back for work done well thus far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Drive 4: <strong>Ownership &amp; Possession&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"367\" height=\"714\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.55.37.png?resize=367%2C714&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15329\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Competitions recognize success with gold coins redeemable on virtual stores</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to call this the pride of ownership drive. When we possess something, we strive to make it better. It\u2019s like the teenager who is forever washing and polishing her/his new, albeit dilapidated, car. In a business context, it\u2019s a little different. There the need to answer WIIFM is an imperative. Once answered, knowing what\u2019s in it for me can be a powerful motivator. I see this as the drive that can truly serve to transform an employee. Once it becomes clear that it\u2019s that employees stats, points, badges, whatever, s/he wants to keep it and will work hard to do so. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.57.07.png?resize=1000%2C656&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15330\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This core manifests itself as a competition on our platform that\u2019s about gaining coins redeemable on virtual stores we operate on behalf of our customers. A multinational BPO that provides customer support services conducted just such a game among its many and diverse employees. Given the choice between tangible and intangible rewards &#8211; both of which could be delivered to their workstation in moments &#8211; these employees overwhelmingly opted for the ones that hold an intrinsic value. They selected accessories to add to their avatars which, not so incidentally, are seen on the company\u2019s leaderboards. It wasn\u2019t that the tangible rewards weren\u2019t appealing. Employees wanted the sheer joy of feeling good about doing something well&#8230;or better than their peers&#8230;and leveling up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Drive 5: <strong>Social Influence &amp; Relatedness</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"363\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.53.43.png?resize=363%2C709&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15328\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Our platform allows personalized messages to be sent to employees on an automated basis</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Peer pressure, in a business situation, if managed well can have a dramatic, positive impact on organizational performance. We recognize that in our platform\u2019s ability to put in place challenges that are peer-to-peer or team-based. In addition, our Kudos feature comes into play here. It relates to this drive in that employees can give and get kudos. There\u2019s the social pressure aspect along with friending and mentorship. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1330\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.57.38.png?resize=1330%2C512&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15331\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Kudos allow employees to give and receive recognition</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Kudos includes categories like \u201cYou\u2019re a great leader,\u201d You\u2019re Inspiring,\u201d \u201cThanks for Your Help,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Fun to Work With.\u201d This allows employees to give and get kudos to coworkers and managers, and for managers to do the same. I should add, these kudos can include personalized notes. One of our clients used Kudos in this way to build a culture of cooperation as well as to identify the under-the-radar transformative employees, those receiving the most kudos.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1152\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-18.58.51.png?resize=1152%2C626&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15332\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Peer-to-peer and team challenges only have one winner, so achieving stretch<br /> goals in a short time comes with extra reward.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Drive 6:<strong> Scarcity &amp; Impatience</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This core centers on the human desire to have something you can\u2019t or don\u2019t have. We leverage that by allocating a limited number of reward prizes in virtual stores. Beyond that, we use it in challenges where there can be only one winner. While that might seem contrary to the desire to improve performance overall or give the impression that everyone has a chance to win, there are work situations where a company really wants to find out who is the very best of the bunch. To add fire to this fury, these single winner challenges, crafted to fit within several segments to allow for more than one victor, are often done within very tight timeframes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Drive 7:<strong> Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ice hockey great Wayne Gretsky is known for saying, \u201cYou miss every shot you don\u2019t take.\u201d Those seven words brilliantly sum up why unpredictability is a core driver. We want to find out &#8211; whatever it happens to be. And, by extension, curiosity has us poking our noses into things that, maybe, we shouldn\u2019t be. In a work environment, employees are often moved by finding out what\u2019s happening next or what needs to be done next. Our platform lets notifications be issued to let employees understand what they should do next in their jobs or to get closer to earning a bonus. Akin to notifications, our system issues what we call Boosters. These are messages that either urge an employee to keep up the good work or work a bit harder &#8211; always in a positive, motivational manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature we have is User Initiated Challenges. Basically, these are competitions created by individual employees. The wrinkle we\u2019ve put in is making it necessary to \u201cput some skin in the game,\u201d to ante up and either bet on themselves, for individual challenges, or with their peers. To participate in such a challenge, you need to buy in. It makes the challenges far more compelling than if there is little at risk. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Drive 8: <strong>Loss &amp; Avoidance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"420\" height=\"826\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-24-19.00.46.png?resize=420%2C826&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15335\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Missing a day of work is missing a day of<br /> points</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As kids we might have done our homework just to avoid a punishment from our parents. Employees often operate the same way. For example, the idea of being able to maintain a streak of some sort, perhaps accumulating points in a process, is a powerful motivator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At retail, asking sales associates to do what you need them to do isn\u2019t always easy. While they\u2019re competitive, finding the path of least resistance to their bonuses spurs them. Our customer Cellular Sales, a Verizon premier retail partner with 7,000 sales associates, had a problem each time a new iPhone hit the market. Sales of everything but the new device plummeted. Not a good thing for an organization that cannot depend on an unpredictable parade of hit products to drive sales. They used our KPI balance feature with a mix of competitions to help raise new device sales 53% but, and this is important, also raise sales of accessory sales and insurance bundles similarly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you have it.

Great work showing how the new items fit into the game loops on the Island. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://island.octalysisprime.com/uploads/user_uploads/5b5df3ac64b2bc5f0db1f235/IIV_Create%20an%20object%2021581248826186.pdf\">Here is I\u00f1aki&#8217;s presentation.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1195\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-26-07.37.50.png?resize=1195%2C668&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15350\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>The Alchemy Set</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"669\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-26-07.36.53.png?resize=1200%2C669&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15349\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Game Loop WITH I\u00f1aki&#8217;s new items included</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finalist: Sergio</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sergio offered Octalysians, a character-based layer for encounters, new information, and boosters to current gameplay, with possibility to add new kinds of gameplay in the future with new characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://island.octalysisprime.com/uploads/user_uploads/5c3f52b03a5a1417c42188e3/Items-Challenge-Sergio-Ligato-Submission-rev21581370304518.pdf\">Here is Sergio&#8217;s presentation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1197\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-26-07.38.32.png?resize=1197%2C671&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15351\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Sergio&#8217;s example of interaction with the Shaman</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finalist: Olivier</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With Olivier&#8217;s Spill Filter, Wagering, and Geomon Stroll, there would be knew ways to play the game in a non-linear way.

I happen to know his son Ashlin Parker has used the Octalysis framework to ideate and improve the Trumpet Mafia experience.

Most companies struggle to create products that customers fall in love with, continue using, and passionately share with their friends. Some of these products have great \u201cfunctional\u201d purposes, but don\u2019t focus on the motivation and Core Drives of their users.</p>\n<p>In a previous era, consumers didn\u2019t have adequate information and were accustomed to slow gratification. Along with immense barriers for starting new companies, it was not as detrimental for a company to simply assume that customers would use their products &#8211; provided that they were marketed correctly. However, people today are spoiled with instant gratification through the Internet, with immersive empowerment and real-time feedback through games, and the constant connection to their social network. Your users, customers, and employees are becoming less tolerant of badly designed products that do not take into account their motivations, especially when they have a variety of competitive alternatives they can choose from.</p>\n<h3>Status Quo Sloth of Startup Adoption</h3>\n<p>Many corporations and startups excitedly tell me, \u201cOur product is great! Users can do this; users can do that; and they can even do these things!\u201d And my response to them has been, \u201cYes, you are telling me all the things your users *can* do. But you have not explained to me *why* the user would do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the problem with a majority of company products \u2013 great technology and functionalities, but no traction. People don\u2019t have a reason to go out of their way to use the product. Sometimes, a startup founder tells me, \u201cHey, Yu-kai, there\u2019s no reason why people wouldn\u2019t use our product. We save them money, we save them time, and we make their lives better.\u201d On lucky days, customers themselves would even say, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s no reason why I wouldn\u2019t use your product. It saves me money, it saves me time, and it makes my life better. I\u2019ll definitely sign-up sometime tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>For those who have run startups or launched products before, you know the crucial part of the entire phrase is the ending. When people say they will do it \u201ctomorrow,\u201d more often than not it means \u201cnever.\u201d This is because at this point they are motivated by Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance, and specifically by something I call Status Quo Sloth (Game Technique #85) \u2013 they are avoiding a change in their habits and behavior.</p>\n<p>Remember how we talked about how Gamification is actually Human-Focused Design learned from decades, even centuries of game design experience? When you are launching a new product, its motivational standing is very similar to a game. No one <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">has</span> to play a game. You have to do your taxes; you have to go to work; and you really should go to the gym. But you never have to play a game, and let\u2019s be honest, oftentimes you shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Because games have invested an amazing amount of creativity, innovation, and resources into figuring out how to get people to want to spend more time on them, there are definitely many great lessons you can learn from games for your own products. The key here is to make a product so exciting that customers become obsessed with using your product and are compelled to share how exciting their experiences were to\u00a0their friends.</p>\n<h2>2)\u00a0Workplace Gamification</h2>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Workplace Gamification is the craft of creating environments and systems that inspire and motivate employees towards their work. More often than not, employees show up to work every day just so they can earn a paycheck (Core Drive 4: Ownership &amp; Possession) and to not lose their jobs (Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance). As a result, employees only work hard enough to earn their paychecks and to not lose their jobs (if you recall, Core Drives 4 and 8 are great examples of Left Brain, Extrinsic and Black Hat Motivation).</p>\n<p>In fact, Gallup\u2019s 142-country study shows that only 13% of employees are categorized as \u201cengaged\u201d with their work. In comparison, 24% of the workforce is categorized as \u201cActively Disengaged,\u201d which means they are so unhappy with their work that they minimize their productivity, spread negativity, and even sabotage productive efforts that require them to do more work to keep their jobs.</p>\n<p>That is something pretty scary to think about. It means that, chances are, a quarter of your company is poisonous! How can any organism be competitive at anything if 24% of its body is composed of cancer cells?</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular self-denial, it is actually not the employees\u2019 fault they are disengaged. Companies like Zappos and Google (especially in the old days) are known to get their employees motivated, driven, and excited about their work on a daily basis. I firmly believe that everyone has the capacity and the longing to become motivated and driven for something that is worth their cause. It is bad environmental and cultural design that turns good employees into toxic cells.</p>\n<p>Of course, you don\u2019t need a Gallup study to know how disengaged employees are at work. Just think about how often people close to you complain about their work or their bosses. Think about the movie Office Space, the quintessential comedy about life in a typical bland, rigid, and oppressive company in America. The movie was such a great hit and now a cult classic because people can actually relate to the frustration and disengagement of the characters in the movie (a good example of the &#8220;relatedness&#8221; piece within Core Drive 5 at work).</p>\n<p>Why does that matter? Because research has shown that on average, the companies with disengaged and unmotivated employees only obtain 50% of profits and only 40% of revenue growth when compared to companies with engaged and motivated employees. If I told you that you could double your profits and improve your revenue growth by 250% without opening new markets and without introducing new breakthrough technologies but by simply making your workplace more engaging and motivating, would you do it? Most people would say yes. But from my own personal experience, there will still be people who say no, simply because, \u201cI don\u2019t want my employees playing games. It\u2019s a distraction!\u201d</p>\n<p>Workplace Gamification is critical for today\u2019s economy and the future of creative innovation. The Gen-Ys entering the workforce (and they are in their thirties now) are used to being in environments that provide them Epic Meaning, Relatedness, Autonomy, and more. This will only get worse as the even-younger generation enters the workforce, so it is wise for companies to start setting up the correct motivations systems as early as possible to avoid the devastation of having a surplus in labor but a shortage in talent.</p>\n<h2>Marketing Gamification</h2>\n<p>Marketing Gamification is the art of creating holistic marketing campaigns that engage users in fun and unique experience designed for a product, service, platform, or brand. Not too long ago, people clicked on online ads because, more often than not, they couldn\u2019t tell the difference between ads and content. But nowadays, users are becoming more sophisticated in filtering out unwanted promotions, decreasing the effectiveness of many advertisement campaigns (thanks in large part to ad blocker apps too).</p>\n<p>Then you have TV commercials, where everyone simply tunes them out, switches the channel away, or just fast-forwards if they have a TiVo. As for other traditional methods like ads on billboards or newspapers\u2026don\u2019t even get me started.</p>\n<p>In the past decade, Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) have proven to be fairly effective techniques for gaining exposure and improving sales. In fact, a search engine is just a large leaderboard, and the industry of Search Engine Optimization is simply the game to climb to the top of that leaderboard. This works because 1) you can target the right people who are searching for your exact solution, and 2) you can target them at the right time they are searching.</p>\n<p>However, SEO and SEM still lack the <strong>trust</strong> component in online marketing. If a website you trust and have followed for two years sells something you need, you are likely not going to go searching for a random site on a search engine to purchase from.</p>\n<p>Enter\u00a0Social Media Marketing. Through platforms like blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube, brands are able to build relationships with potential customers, create unique value, and establish trust that leads to future engagement. Unfortunately, social media platforms are just the delivery channels for engaging content; in and of themselves, they do not motivate or successfully engage with users.</p>\n<p>This is where Gamification comes in. Marketing Gamification specifically utilizes game elements and strategies throughout a player\u2019s journey by first focusing on why a user would engage with you in the first place.</p>\n<p>Marketing shouldn\u2019t just be one action done from the marketer and one response back from the customer, but should be an entire ecosystem where both the marketer and customer are able to experience fun and feel continuously engaged through a variety of\u00a0interactions.</p>\n<p>Marketing Gamification utilizes the platforms and vehicles described above as well as others: SEO, Social Media, Blogging, Email Marketing, online/offline competitions, viral vehicle strategies, and reward schedules to continuously engage users throughout an engaging and gamified experience.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Gamification</h2>\n<p>I mentioned in Chapter 1 that my life completely changed when I was struck by an epiphany that I should treat everything like a game. Since gamification is great at motivating people towards certain activities, why wouldn\u2019t you apply that to motivate yourself?</p>\n<p>Lifestyle Gamification involves applying gamification principles and the 8 Core Drives into daily habits and activities, such as managing your to-do list, exercising more often, waking up on time, eating healthier, or learning a new language.</p>\n<p>There are also many technological enablers that make Lifestyle Gamification more popular, including big buzzword trends such as Big Data, Wearable Tech, Quantified Self, and The Internet of Things. The interesting thing about all these trends is that it enables all your activity to be tracked allowing you the ability to manage your Feedback Mechanics and Triggers.</p>\n<p>Games have historically been able to track every single action that a player makes. A game would automatically know that this particular player is on Level three, she has picked up these four items, learned these three skills, talked to these six characters, but not those other three characters, and because of that, this door does not open for the player.</p>\n<p>A game remembers everything you have done and customizes your experience based on that. In real-life, most of your \u201cdata\u201d is not recorded, and so it is hard to craft a optimized lifestyle. The trend with wearable tech and quantified self finally allows us to track more of our own behavior on a daily basis. Of course, even companies that claim they wield the power of Big Data don\u2019t yet compare to the level of customization that gamers take for granted. Many still stick to generalized demographics and non-actionable reports, instead of creating a unique experience for each user in real-time.</p>\n<p>Lifestyle Gamification branches into a few sectors such as Career Gamification, Health Gamification, Productivity Gamification, and Education Gamification. It can be utilized to gamify big picture activities such as accomplishing your life goals, or very tactical activities such as using a dice to determine how you should reward yourself (which is derived from Core Drive 7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity).</p>\n<p>Since Lifestyle Gamification fundamentally changed my life, I am extremely passionate about how it can help people achieve their dreams through 1. Finding their game, 2. Analyzing their initial stats 3. Formulating their skill trees, 4. Connecting with allies, 5. Finding the right quests, and 6. Beating the game. Since this is a huge topic that warrants its own book, I won\u2019t be spending time in this book covering the topic in detail.</p>\n<p>So far we have laid out a wide net that covers many terms, concepts, Core Drives, Experience Phases, natures of motivation, and implementations of design. Don\u2019t feel intimidated. For the next few chapters, we begin to dive deeper into all the things we already talked about, which will allow you to have an even better grasp of the foundation of the Octalysis Framework.</p>\n",

I am one of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://join.octalysisprime.com/op-so-wl/\" target=\"_blank\">Octalysis Prime</a> members who took part in <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/education-gamification/octalysis-design-challenge-food-heroes-part-2/\">Food Heroes Challenge 2</a>.  This challenge made the Octalysis Prime community want to contribute to making the Food Heroes user experience more and more engaging for many kids who, together with their parents and teachers, discover and develop better eating habits and at the same time make the world a better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gamification or Game Design?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the goals of this challenge was to plan a game experience that could have been replayed in different contexts (dining table, canteens,  classroom) and able to guarantee long term engagement. The aspect that I found to be more stimulating was surely the necessity to plan the experiences according to both the logic<strong> of gamification</strong> and the <strong>rules of game design</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding the first of these two points, \u201c<strong>5-Step Design Process</strong>\u201d by Yu-Kai Chou has been the most useful and complete guideline to approach the process with a \u201c<strong>human-focused design</strong>\u201d. For the latter, I found it useful to refer to inspirations very close to me: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\">the Octalysis framework</a>, the elemental tetrad by Jesse Schell and my own gaming experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth element is my son. He is 7 years old and he -unknowingly- helped me through the analysis of the gamers and gaming tests (bearing patiently and bravely with the sudden changes in rules and supporting my work with his encouraging \u201c<em>Dad, when are we going to play your game again?</em>\u201d).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gamification and Game Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I would like to share with you five tips that have been useful to me in the design and realization of <strong>FoodVentures</strong>,  a card game, similar to \u201cdungeon crawler\u201d in which the players explore dungeons, facing challenges and hazards while looking out for seeds and keeping them. FoodVentures was planned, taking into consideration the four aspects listed by Jesse Schell as basic elements of every gaming experience: <strong>aesthetics, story, mechanics and technology</strong>.  The card game FoodVentures is thought of as a component of a bigger project, including activities and player experiences not just practically but also digitally, through an app for mobile devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5 Useful Tips to Design Your Game Prototype</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#1 &#8211; Work on The Aesthetics (as Much as You Can)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Visual design has a key role in any gaming experience and it is constituted by the <em>visual stimulus used to evoke specific sensations in the player</em>.  Colours shapes and materials used for the components, fonts, style of  the illustrations contribute to project the player in the game\u2019s setting, being it historical, futuristic or abstract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FoodVentures aims to put the player in the same atmosphere of the entire Food Heroes project, using illustrated cards with elements ascribable to learning goals (types of healthy foods, colour, season, food\u2019s typical environment); the fastest way to develop a \u201cplayable\u201d prototype was to start from a white deck of cards and a set of markers. I looked up online for graphic elements to sketch the white side of the cards, to make it \u201ckids proof\u201d(extremely hard task if you\u2019re using a symbolic -and not evocative- language). A good alternative to drawing could be printing the images in good quality on adhesive paper and put the cards in protective card sleeves to shuffle them easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio1.jpg?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15267\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio1.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>FoodVentures prototype playtesting</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#2 &#8211; Write Your Story</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Game Loop is one of the fundamental elements for a good outcome of the game. A linear experience with no boosters (Game Technique #31) does not benefit the long term engagement of the player (boosters allow players to design game strategy). Through the correct use of boosters, you can stimulate the player to form his own strategy and plan ahead,  pushing them to discover many different means of interaction with the various elements of the game, resulting in a different gaming experience every time. The first question I asked myself when beginning to write a  storyline for FoodVentures was: \u201c<em>Is there in the project any legends, mysterious places, fun facts or bizarre character to inspire me?</em>\u201d The answers were many, but I decided to start from the fascinating and special place: <strong>Seed Vault</strong>,  an existing place in Norway where the genetic heritage of original seeds is kept and preserved. This place was the baseline for the following story, framing the FoodVentures game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio2.png?resize=960%2C540&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15268\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio2.png?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio2.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio2.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>FoodVentures Story part 1</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio3.png?resize=960%2C540&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15269\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio3.png?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio3.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio3.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>FoodVentures Story part 2</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The story was then helpful for choosing a <em>suggestive name for each and every element of the game</em>,  like the virtual value, powerups, hurdles, and eventually villains,  levels, experience points and so on. Obviously there are many other ways to give a sparkle to your creativity and write a good story for your new game, one of my favourites is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://fabuladeck.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Fabula</a>,  a card deck that allows you to always have all the elements to build your own stories or analyse someone else\u2019s, from the easiest to the most complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/181569068\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#3 &#8211; Define the Mechanics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first game I ever designed was a bad copy of Monopoly. As most of the games designed by somebody who has only ever played Monopoly has and will always be. Once, during an interview with a game designer, I  asked him what he thought of my game. He said, \u201c<em>it depends</em>\u201d. \u201c<em>If it is a game for classrooms, it is fine. If you want to sell it, there\u2019s a long way to go</em>\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Confronting with him was really interesting, and the biggest lesson I got out of it was \u201c<em><strong>if you want to design good games you have to play, play, play</strong></em>\u201d.  Since then, I started discovering and experimenting with new games, and  I started seeing the point he was trying to make. I tried many games, some of them just once, some of them I bought and some of them I\u2018ll never be able to try. Luckily for me, on YouTube, there\u2019s a whole army of enthusiasts who show through video materials previews, and mechanics of games that would have otherwise been inaccessible to me. I discovered that watching tutorials is the best way to learn more about games and get inspired.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#4 &#8211; Choose the Technology</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology is represented by materials used (cardboard, wood,  plastic, augmented reality software, cards&#8230;) that are needed for the gaming experience. For my project I chose a practical gaming  experience based on a card deck, mainly for four reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Scalability</em>, the development of new elements and expansions can guarantee a good level of re-playing</li><li>Portability, the fact that the whole game consists of two  decks of cards makes it easy to use in a classroom as well as a  restaurant, or at home</li><li><em>Collectability</em>, the cards can be used for the gaming experience, both competitive or collaborative, or just be collected</li><li><em>Personalisation</em>, the deck representing events regarding  dungeons or places to explore can be set in a new way every time,  allowing the player to choose a setting that will go well with the  hurdles, treasures and event cards</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#5 &#8211; Try it With People, Take Notes, Improve It, Repeat</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that the first prototype is ready, you just have to try it.  Friends, family and acquaintances can be amazing playtestesters. Grab pen and paper and note down any adjustments needed to improve the gaming experience altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This phase is probably the hardest, but <em>so</em> worth it. A good gaming experience normally takes a long trial before being ready for the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, a fun game that you <strong>won\u2019t get enough of is a game in which the aesthetic, story, mechanics,  technology elements are used with balance and in the right way</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These five tips can set you off to a great start if you\u2019re moving the first steps in the fascinating art of game design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Are you ready to play it your way?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About the author</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sergio4.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15270\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://it.linkedin.com/in/sergio-ligato-tdorg\">Sergio Ligato</a> is a proud Octalysis Primer since January 2019.

In actuality, it&#8217;s kind of like a financial credit score system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chinese government is trying to measure how good of a Chinese citizen you are. Are you patriotic? Are you paying your loans? This has been hugely controversial because the whole world sees that it&#8217;s like \u2018Wow, that&#8217;s Orwellian.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the examples people like to compare this to is a Black Mirror episode where everything in life is also measured by your social score where people rate you, your rating is too low, you can get locked out of renting a car or getting a mortgage.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LTAb6CVhV5UZoLMgBbONNfQHrCvFoHP3Ii7Gn1V8hvmVFIJQf1DHNsMkz-7jp4UC2yJKUmDZ-kVvAP-Z7Ht_1Ucvlrevz-rXdxfa3kFvAuvCfDusDK_L7KvcTeJtaYSMaW237TqX\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And in this Black Mirror episode, the dystopian scenario crashes down upon this lady who is so obsessed with getting a high score that she kept doing things to promote it, but ended up losing out.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China system, right, it&#8217;s very interesting because it doesn&#8217;t just measure your financial credit score it breaks your credit score in five categories. Kind of like the attribute webchart we talked about in gameful education.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background Characteristics</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yMFD-g1ZSHqteFtuQF0PkdCgVM1QdiSjI7ip-FzisbhC_3kkjb7Kc2XmvR96SxUUibZ3cBmDqXWiFkUDBzPERRdmKioWMLy7R7v-mNUxeKDTKQZwdSNEwvUjIDkMHxT0ExspBTCL\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is your background characteristics. Who you are. The school you came out of. So that&#8217;s just your identity, right, that will give you a score.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preferences and Tendencies</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/J_lPzKhZ98e8_Wg7Aqv8W80vAuZK5u-p9lCChREENzgM1VXa7j2oLOZtgH57Ndqn4Vdl4SLlD0LUMjc2xcakpxxBCn-FE-XNGh7ynRmFa7iaU8vz3YuTR8_nA89Ot5o3o0BqE7PP\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you have your preferences and tendencies. So, what kind of hobbies do you like? Do you like hobbies that support the Chinese government? If you buy a lot of products from overseas, your score actually lowers. So, that&#8217;s it.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Financial Reliability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZOXljqCpiQp4PRaaBAIHRi46XLqbSQ9X6mPfLDoJqaQdjyHOq3TZMSdlMn9bK2CZ03J0LXOonk-iAZs4tDmRRww27Viy9dVdQa5NXKrjAaEzDzN2bQD0uVMv7VHVRtgqcWEUgsxs\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to pay back your debt, and how trustworthy and reliable you are, so it&#8217;s basically or literally how well you can pay on time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Interpersonal Connections</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8QHO0wIb4t79a3eorYyPCwf131Qc8CGehbHMEl48PZk2-xQjSgsghcquQfZsOVV20_DfwEAPMZi-6i4PL9UjWwNeWYcCs4QZEVR5WrLIkp86Be_DgjVrLaWzjexJ3AGfPty7wFNG\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there are your personal connections. So this is actually probably the most controversial one, because, basically, is your friends and family have a low score, then you will have a lower score too. So you really have two options. If you notice, people are doing things that are not patriotic and they&#8217;re low, and low scores, then you have two options. Number one is to disassociate yourself. You know, don&#8217;t interact with them at all because if you interact with them you&#8217;re gonna decrease. Or, you got to convince them to be a good citizen again, don&#8217;t badmouth these events. Right. And so, that becomes a very stressful time where people would perhaps trust each other less because they don&#8217;t want other people to know that internally they&#8217;re feeling, disgruntled about something but they can&#8217;t let anyone else know.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Credit History</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qaYkUtwFAcqb5LFr39rFSU9XQ1x-bzKPXeXMhYjsclXqeSznUYH3IvBR5JNjEvuXl14GpGxdVwgAd-0z2hvAlJ2oPA6nvR-4tYwyClcIf49I1v0t7JR3LxUgfdpZfV1eR64t5Mc7\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally, the last point is your credit history. Normal financial credit history, and then all these five characteristics combined into one total score. And this score, China, they deploy the social throughout China in 2020, but I think I saw reports delay they wanted to late 2021, but they have experimented and have ongoing experiments in many different places now so this is actually real implementation.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implementation and Results</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, 23 million people have been discredited or barred from traveling. I think about around 17 million couldn&#8217;t buy plane tickets anymore and 5 or 6 million people are unable to take the train. And so the idea is that hey if you are not worthy, right, you don&#8217;t have the credit. You&#8217;re in the country, then you shouldn&#8217;t be traveling go to damage control, quarantine you almost.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one very interesting story is that there is a Chinese actress barred from boarding an airplane. She walked to the airport computer screen with checkout and showed that she had a low score because she was guilty of defaming her boyfriend&#8217;s ex-lover. And she did not apologize. So, they didn&#8217;t let her on the plane because she had a bad citizen behavior and she couldn&#8217;t get on the plane. And then, once she apologized to her boyfriend&#8217;s ex-lover, that ban was lifted and then she could go take planes after that.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7AnvFVjsJ6a-GkCbkFxp9cB5K72H6xioZ0RVM9-5Af9SyeJBEAGXubve2CAmC0wpf8NEmairNh0uaI8p6-oT99z5_AhNb0ghahHVAKVOa3i548nXLKduiohernJOpnsXbnkKbdpS\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, again, some people think it&#8217;s crazy and ridiculous how our government would prevent you from using, transportation, based on what you say about someone else, you might think &#8220;that feels like a complete lack of freedom and China is obviously trying to monitor more people.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think as of now, there are over 200 million video cameras on the streets and alleys of China, and China&#8217;s goal for this year is actually have over 626 million cameras deployed throughout 2020. In comparison, there are only about 330 million people in the US, so they literally want twice the amount of Americans in cameras in China, and there are about 1.4 billion people in China, pretty generous and still only about one camera for every two citizens so it&#8217;s not so bad, right. They didn&#8217;t think that every Chinese citizen needs one camera, a very controversial thing that&#8217;s going on.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if you have a good score?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And, oh, and of course, if you do well if you have a high credit score, then you might get rewarded with discounts benefits special opportunities and whatnot. And so, that&#8217;s the part that is controversial I want to talk about that and then we&#8217;ll talk about how the Chinese people. And surprisingly actually the Chinese people really like it. And then we&#8217;ll move into the actual design itself. Is it a good or bad design? <br /></p>\n",

That felt lazy and I don\u2019t even remember who offered it because they\u2019ve been erased from my memory.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Doing it well</strong>: Some moments are rare (organizing certain people to be at an event all at the same time to share knowledge), and letting people know this event is a once in a lifetime occurrence (even though many events are once in a lifetime) isn\u2019t untruthful, and attending said event might be just what that attendee needs right now.\u00a0I don\u2019t take an ethical position on this necessarily, but I do personally feel it is weak to shall we say manufacture scarcity, and when I see it I personally ding the person/company reputationally in my personal scoring system. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don&#8217;t Resort to FOMO Tactics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, there are tradeoffs to using FOMO tactics. Maybe you are happy to get quick conversions because you believe SO much in your product that the reputational ding people like me will give you upfront can be recouped (or you&#8217;ve charged enough for your product/service/event that you don&#8217;t care). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are comfortable with this tradeoff, then FOMO tactics do work. How much you walk the line reputationally is your own call. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there another way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there is! One way is to consider the full range of psychological drives, including the 8 Core Drives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking a human-focused design approach will let you win in the long run, which, if you have something valuable to share with the world, is where you want to live. </p>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p>Hey Primers. Today, we&#8217;re going to talk about the endgame loot design systems, between World of Warcraft, and Diablo III. We will see how they apply different understandings of commitment and reward within their player experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This video was originally published on <a href=\"https://octalysisprime.com\">OctalysisPrime.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/309809760\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>And this relates to this topic that we talked about a little bit which is the mythic dungeon system and the loot box system that attaches to it. (Also on OctalysisPrime.com) </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background on World of Warcraft and Diablo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for some background: World of Warcraft and Diablo are both<br /> Blizzard games. They&#8217;re made by this gaming company called Blizzard. They&#8217;re both very successful. They create some of the best franchises in the world. And there&#8217;s a difference between the two games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diablo, even though they both seem like what we call RPGs role-playing games. Diablo is a hack-and-slash. There&#8217;s almost nothing else you can do. You go in, kill monsters, destroy everything, go home, look at your loot and then go out and destroy everything again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>World of Warcraft is more of what they call an MMORPG, massively multiplayer online role-playing game, which means you&#8217;re in a world where you can explore. You can go into professions like you alchemy, you can create guilds and you have all these different types of activities in that world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, these two games are different in nature, one is more immersive and exploratory, and the other is more satisfying your sensation drive, just go in and destroy all these monsters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>World of Warcraft has been a very successful game. People have been paying monthly fees of $10-15 every single month after $40-60 purchases of the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more than 15 years, so it&#8217;s very very successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trying to Solve Endgame Problems</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But it still has a lot of problems to solve. And it was trying to create a good end game design. So basically on each expansion which the new beta version of a release, people would play hardcore: they get the highest gear, they have so many great things. And they feel like, &#8220;Well, why do I still play this game?&#8221; And so the designers wanted to figure out how to do good end game design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s take a moment to discuss Diablo III, but first, some background in Diablo II.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diablo II was a very very successful game, people played for 5-10 years, and they still love the game. And then Diablo III came out. And the first version, everyone hated it. It was not so great. Some people enjoyed it but got old real fast, they thought it was a crappy game and didn&#8217;t want to play it so much and there was all this issue with the real money auction house, which will evaluate in another video. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that they didn&#8217;t like this end game design. Most people still played hundreds of hours on Diablo III but then they said, &#8220;Wow, we only play it for three months and then it got boring.&#8221; But they wanted to play for 5-10 years as they had with Diablo II. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the new version of Diablo III, called Reaper of Souls, they eventually solved all these problems. People felt it was fun again they went back for a lot more of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Reaper of Souls they introduced the mythical dungeon system, what people do is they would choose what level they want to play (mythic level one, level two, level 10, level 50, and his skills up, and if you can beat the mythical dungeon within a certain timeframe then you get rewarded greatly for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in World of Warcraft, the latest version which is 8.0<br /> called The Battle for Azeroth, they wanted to solve this issue too, so even in the previous version, 7.0, they adapted this as some of the mythical dungeons and mythical plus, which is just building higher and higher levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked about this in one of my game design videos, called the Mythic Keystone Chest design, we talked about that mythic plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why do Players Still Complain? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, even with that system, a lot of people still complain about World of Warcraft. And so, why is that the case? It was very unexpected because people really liked it in Diablo III, but people didn&#8217;t like the whole system as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mythic plus system, especially the loot system, and all that work. What is the difference? Now we keep in mind, when we think about the end game, this is all about the endgame, people are motivated to play in this game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oftentimes, because of <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/the-8-core-drives-of-gamification-7-unpredictability/\">Core Drive 7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity</a>, that attaches to <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-4-ownership-possession/\">Core Drive 4: Ownership &amp; Possession</a>, and <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-2-development-accomplishment/\">Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of time the <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-3-empowerment-creativity-feedback/\">Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback</a> is no longer there. There are some social aspects but for Diablo, it doesn&#8217;t have to be social for World of Warcraft, it&#8217;s a little more social.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Diablo is a slot machine design. You go into the dungeon. And when you kill these monsters you kill the boss, it&#8217;s like pulling off a machine, and something will drop out from the boss, and maybe something you want maybe you want, but when it drops you get cooler gear and a lot of challenge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge goes on at a higher level mythic dungeon, and just rinse and repeat so it&#8217;s just this big casino game that you&#8217;re playing over and over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, while World of Warcraft was doing the same thing, you play this big dungeon that requires five players to be part of. And after defeating a lot of costs, anywhere from four to eight big bosses, you get a reward, sometimes that is what you really want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sounds a lot like Diablo III&#8217;s system, so why is World of Warcraft not doing as well? Why are people complaining and so angry about it? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Literature of Mystery Box Designs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This goes back to the literature of mystery box design. I believe I was, as far as I know, the first person to have come up with different CD7 design types that recognize different kinds of mystery box designs</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Diablo III, the commitment to get the mystery box was lower. They weren&#8217;t willing to do drawn out commitments. But the lower commitment worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, what the Blizzard developers didn&#8217;t think of&#8211;and they are really experienced game designers&#8211;was that for Diablo, you can complete a dungeon by yourself, you don&#8217;t have to organize a bunch of people get friends together you can just go by yourself, and then finish it in anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes, very very fast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas in World of Warcraft, for this dungeon again you have to find other players to play with you and be very committed because remember we talked about, if one person drops out, then the whole thing breaks down. That&#8217;s a high-stress kind of situation. A lot of times it takes 20 minutes or even longer just to find the right teammates to be with you. People have to log in at the same time, producing a huge commitment just to get together. And when you do a World of Warcraft dungeon, it takes anywhere between 40 minutes to three hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big difference between these two designs is that in<br /> Diablo, you get to play the slot machines, over and over and over again really quickly. It&#8217;s a small commitment to see what you win. And therefore, really well for that pacing for that dynamic for World of Warcraft, it&#8217;s a huge commitment to pull the slot machine bar, and if you do all this work of the sweat, blood, and tears, and you pull the slot machine bar (and don&#8217;t get what you like) you can&#8217;t decide, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna do this again for 10 times today&#8221;, because you don&#8217;t have the time to do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The psychological result? You tried this one I saw that it was not worth it (you committed a lot of time and effort and didn&#8217;t get the loot outcome). So you leave and you&#8217;re unhappy. Yeah, absolutely. The nature of the mystery box design has a positive effect for Diablo III, but not for World of Warcraft, at least how they are currently using it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Observe Mystery Box Designs You See</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want you to soak in this knowledge and understand that it doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re creating a game, if you&#8217;re trying to get good game design. If you try to create behavioral change, by understanding these psychological principles of the 8 Core Drives and these game design techniques you can avoid mistakes that even these top game designers are making and jump to something better, creating engaging experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I hope you&#8217;ll share in the comments is about your own experiences with mystery box designs. How were they set up, what were their rules, and how did those experiences make you feel? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve seen other games use these designs, I&#8217;d be super impressed if you could share whether they succeeded or failed based on your understanding of the Core Drives. With that said, I&#8217;ll see you soon in another video. </p>\n",

Why did you do it?</p>\n<p>I asked myself this very question a few days ago. To my analytical yet generous mind, there is a distribution of reasoning.</p>\n<p>These range from ideological to practical. From concerns of privacy to a desire to create free time to reallocate toward my updated medium-term goals, like learning to code at an amateur level and to grasp the history of money.</p>\n<p>Since I subscribe to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard\">theories of mimetic desire</a>, part of me feels as though I quit Facebook because other people were doing it, which in itself is not always by itself a good reason for doing anything (if you&#8217;ll allow me to understate my point).</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t pause or suspend or disable my account: <strong>I permanently deleted it.</strong> Part of me feels that I permanently deleted it to prove to myself that I could. (When I played online poker, I occasionally entertained folding pocket aces pre-flop to demonstrate I could make a bad play, to illustrate that I&#8211;whatever I is&#8211;was in charge.)</p>\n<p>A year later, what are the Pros and Cons of the decision?</p>\n<h2>Pros of Leaving Facebook Behind</h2>\n<p><strong>More Free Time:</strong><br />I do have additional time each day which I&#8217;ve reallocated to other activities. Note: This was part of my <a href=\"https://calnewport.com\">digital minimalism kick</a>&#8211;to use digital technologies selectively, in other words to choose those which amplify my velocity toward my goals.</p>\n<p><strong>More Attention:</strong> <br />Understanding one&#8217;s conscious attention is a detailed and complicated topic. To my way of thinking, understanding how one&#8217;s attention works is a private and personal activity. A journey that you have to take on your own. Even useful meditation apps like Waking Up will only get you part of the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Seeing the Forest and the Trees:</strong><br />Take a moment to notice how this sentence affects you. That sentence wasn&#8217;t so emotionally resonant. Neither was that one. So what?, you might reactively ask. But\u00a0<em>that</em> is the point. (For one thing, I&#8217;ve learned to read better&#8230;and to notice less good writing and better writing.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>&#8220;Slowing down&#8221; in appropriate ways lets me see the forest and the trees. It also lets me examine products and services and how those human-product or human-service interactions engage my attention. There&#8217;s a layer of meta-cognition here which is difficult to appreciate, but rewarding. In <a href=\"https://octalysisprime.com\">Octalysis Prime</a>, we are doing our best to help our members notice how the activity or game loops they create for their players, members, and customers acknowledge the human there.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cons of Leaving Facebook &#8212; And Trying to Return</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Value of Your Network:<br /></strong>Last night at a holiday party, I was where I grew up. Gabon, Indonesia, China, USA. Most of the friends and contacts I made in those places were filed in Facebook. Gone are the digital branches connecting me with those people. (It is hard, but not impossible, to regrow them. Some people have found me again, and me them.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Managing Facebook Groups:<br /></strong>I want to manage a Facebook Group for work&#8211;Octalysis Explorers&#8211;which is the largest gamification group on Facebook. In one sense, it is the largest base (outside our mailing list of 30k+) of people who we as a company enjoy talking and hanging out with. Since I&#8217;m the Community Manager for Octalysis Prime, it would be useful to understand who those people are too, but I haven&#8217;t been able to get back on Facebook, at least not within Facebook&#8217;s standard rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I recently added a new user&#8211;first name &#8220;Octalysis&#8221; last name &#8220;Prime&#8221;&#8211; and included my personal details, birthday, email, and phone number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After using Facebook for about 30 minutes, I was asked to upload a picture &#8220;with a face&#8221; at which time I was locked out of Facebook. A few days later, I&#8217;m still not allowed on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess we should acknowledge that Facebook is honoring its commitment to permanently delete my account with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What services have you canceled? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What services have you canceled, vowing to never return, but eventually came back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was the return like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did the service welcome you back? Did they make it easy to jump back in? Hard?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How did it make you feel?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I also left behind Quora, which was one of my favorite social sites, where I had a reasonable following and was a top writer in some topics&#8230;in different but meaningful ways, that was a harder decision than leaving Facebook.</em></p>\n",

This is just Game Technique #2!, called Achievement Symbols. And I&#8217;m taking a look at Twitch today, which by the way is a platform I think you should all look into and understand. It&#8217;s good to know because they are doing a lot of things from a design perspective that have really captured the imagination of a lot of streamers right and those streamers have captured the attention of a lot of advertising dollars. There&#8217;s really a big ecosystem right around this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember my aunt asking me about twitch several years ago when one of her students wasn&#8217;t showing up for class, so it&#8217;s definitely something that is capturing attention from a number of different ways&#8211;that student by the way was streaming games on Twitch and on his way to becoming a pro gamer, or at least trying to. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBW7A9qc-PQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div><figcaption>How Twitch is Deploying the Achievement Symbol</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at this <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/achievement\">Achievement Symbol</a> (icons for use) from the perspective of Twitch <em>as a streamer.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been streaming a game that I like play which is actually a board game called <em>Diplomacy</em>. If you haven&#8217;t played before I strongly recommend you get in touch with me and I&#8217;ll help you get started. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An achievement symbol is simply a way to show that I&#8217;ve developed or accomplished something: developing a skill or accomplishing some kind of goal. And, yeah, it&#8217;s part of this larger reality of humans as goal-oriented beings. We like to see progress towards a goal. If we&#8217;re lost in the woods not sure how to get to the destination, not so much. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recapturing my Attention (and Investment of Creative Labor)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Achievement Symbols that Twitch is using here help move me through <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/4-experience-phases-gamification-2-onboarding-phase/\">the Onboarding process</a>. I&#8217;ve already experienced some friction in establishing my stream and getting my equipment right, and over 9 hours of streaming, but I&#8217;m not monetizable yet. Eventually, I&#8217;ll attract advertising dollars to the platform and draw an audience. That&#8217;s the value tradeoff between the platform and me, the creator. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right away you can see they have several achievement symbols to indicate what I can do here. Community, affiliate, partner, and so forth. After viewing my Achievement Symbol from previous efforts, the reward acts as a trigger to view other possible goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1598\" height=\"888\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/yukaichou.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-24-14.35.16.png?fit=660%2C367&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15105\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-24-14.35.16.png?w=1598&amp;ssl=1 1598w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-24-14.35.16.png?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-24-14.35.16.png?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-24-14.35.16.png?resize=1024%2C569&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>New Day, New Stream</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitch recaptures my attention to bring me back into that activity loop. So, that is an extrinsic, but white hat; it feels good.

Your friend on Facebook just sent you a message!&#8221; That&#8217;s a spot where you have ability to click on it and go to Facebook, a few clicks away, few brain cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2084\" height=\"1216\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/yukaichou.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-13.01.37.png?fit=660%2C385&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Facilitator for high motivation, low ability in BJ Fogg's Triggers\" class=\"wp-image-15051\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-13.01.37.png?w=2084&amp;ssl=1 2084w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-13.01.37.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-13.01.37.png?resize=768%2C448&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-13.01.37.png?resize=1024%2C597&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-13.01.37.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>Facilitator for high motivation, low ability</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make the Spark a Black Hat Trigger</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, the Spark should be a Black Hat Trigger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This happens with our Octalysis Design Challenges, where we also include the upcoming deadline. If we chose to serve up a White Hat Trigger like, &#8220;Good luck as you continue working on your Design Challenge,&#8221; the trigger may not actually drive the desired action of the Octalysis Prime member continuing to work on their Challenge designs and submission.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2124\" height=\"1180\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/yukaichou.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-12.59.48.png?fit=660%2C367&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"BJ Fogg's Triggers\" class=\"wp-image-15050\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-12.59.48.png?w=2124&amp;ssl=1 2124w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-12.59.48.png?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-12.59.48.png?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-12.59.48.png?resize=1024%2C569&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-12.59.48.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>Three types of Prompts</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Facilitator Makes Hard Things Easier</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the facilitator is the scenario where the user has a lot of motivation, but they just don&#8217;t have the ability to do it. The action feels confusing or hard. How to solve this? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the Facilitator. Let me make it easy for you. Maybe it&#8217;s it&#8217;s a software wizard that helps you install something. Maybe it&#8217;s it&#8217;s a counselor who guides you through your career choices. So, the facilitator, again, is the use of trigger to remind you, &#8220;Hey, you should do it. And also if you didn&#8217;t do it because it&#8217;s hard, let me make it easy for you. Let me explain it to you. Let me reduce your brain cycles. Let me give you a discount rate that&#8217;s that&#8217;s really good. Let&#8217;s give you a coupon a discount so now it&#8217;s easier and cheaper to do this action.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Signal Nudges High Motivation &#8211; High Ability users to Take an Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a facilitator, and then finally you have what we call a signal, which is the user already has high motivation, they have high ability, they just aren&#8217;t doing it. And in that case, it&#8217;s very easy to just have a simple &#8220;Hey, do it.&#8221; And there is a high chance the user will take the desired action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bjfogg.com/\">BJ Fogg</a> is definitely a pioneer in our industry. And although I don&#8217;t love his change from triggers to prompts, there is a lot we can learn from him and his methods, including Tiny Habits, which I recommend highly.

This video delves deeper into <a href=\"https://www.behaviormodel.org/\">BJ Fogg&#8217;s behavioral model</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/369931593\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure>\n\n\n<p><em>Here is a lightly edited transcript of the above video</em>.</p>\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re going to go deeper into BJ Fogg&#8217;s behavioral model.</p>\n<p>And so if you recall, the behavior model is:</p>\n<p>Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Trigger (Prompt)</p>\n<p>I might interchange these terms, but I personally liked trigger better. Sometimes, it&#8217;s possible we can stick with the new word, but it just depends on what we&#8217;re looking at. So we&#8217;re going to go deeper into those concepts and understand the elements of motivation, ability, and triggers.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to start with Ability. It&#8217;s very interesting because BJ Fogg throughout his paper calls it the element of Simplicity, with emphasis on ability. So he entertained simplicity ability because most of the time, having high ability means that the design is simple. It&#8217;s usually not necessarily the cost that is prohibitive but it&#8217;s the complexity or difficulty that reduces ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>High Ability = Simple Design</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also says that simplicity comes from six different sources, number one, it comes from time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So if something takes a lot of time, and everyone thinks time is a limited resource, right, they don&#8217;t have enough time to do it. Then they feel like they have lowered ability or decreased simplicity. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second component is money. If somebody is really really expensive. They just can&#8217;t afford to do it or they feel like it&#8217;s just too expensive for them that obviously get, then they have lower ability to take the desired action because it is expensive or, in a sense, it lowers simplicity, </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Physical Effort</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is physical effort. Even the thought of a tremendous amount of physical lowers ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, an action as normal as opening a jar actually requires so much work and we just feel like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s very very hard&#8221; so it makes us not want to open these jars as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Brain Cycles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another common component is actually pretty interesting and less intuitive: BJ Fogg talks about Brain Cycles. If it requires more brain cycles to think about something to like, &#8220;Oh, I get it!&#8221; or &#8220;Hm, what does it mean, I&#8217;m kind of confused,&#8221; that cognitive dissonance actually causes people to lower their ability. This makes sense that it has decreased simplicity and therefore behavior is less likely to happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Social Deviance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If action A represents the social norm and Action B is far away from action A on a map, then Action B represents a deviation from the social norm. Doing so requires more effort. And ability decreases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Non-Routine</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The final one the six components of Ability is Non-Routine. If you&#8217;re doing something again and again, it becomes a habit, doing something that&#8217;s away from your routine. So you have less ability because it&#8217;s so far from that. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From the Octalysis Perspective</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"755\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-08.47.09.png?resize=755%2C419&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Let's examine BJ Fogg from the Octalysis perspective\" class=\"wp-image-15048\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-08.47.09.png?w=755&amp;ssl=1 755w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-14-08.47.09.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Let&#8217;s examine from the Octalysis perspective</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Without time and money, the Anti-Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance motivates people away from certain tasks. And this must be overcome by other Core Drives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to Brain Cycles, the <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-analysis/draft-about-anti-core-drives/\">Anti-Core Drive</a> is <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-2-development-accomplishment/\">Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment</a>.

I wanted to understand this and describe it from an Octalysis lense.</p>\n<h2>Autonomy</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next component is that we feel a sense of autonomy over our actions. This relates to <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-3-empowerment-creativity-feedback/\">Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback</a>. We feel we have many choices, you know, our choices matter which is what we&#8217;re engaged in making those choices and figure out what works and of course that feedback directly makes you adjust and then potentially you&#8217;re overcoming the difficult challenges.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2>Focus on Yourself (and Others)</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another aspect that&#8217;s very interesting is that when we are in Flow our focus isn&#8217;t on ourselves. So if you&#8217;re so focused on yourself, what you&#8217;re doing, or how do you look, you are having something like an extrinsic motivation mindset. It&#8217;s also harder, because we&#8217;re not immersed in the task itself, we are thinking about ourselves, what other people think and how the task is and so that makes the task a little hard.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Timeless</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When an experience is timeless it might lean towards a Flow state,\u00a0 \u00a0which is very interesting component right because it&#8217;s a little bit different from what a lot of other things are some timeless experience which means that you will enjoy this when you&#8217;re fine you enjoy this when you&#8217;re 20 you joined this when you&#8217;re at, and also people 500years ago. Enjoy. But youstill enjoy today so that experience is timeless Hence, it just really brings you into that flow state. Finally, the experiences auto telic, which is a unique word but in a quick summary my interpretation is that all talent just means that you&#8217;re not focusing on yourself you&#8217;re alsofocusing outside of yourself which is again,kind of like the one for your folks herself, you caring about others you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re being unaware of your, your own present </span></p>",

Yu-kai speaks quickly, so fast that even artificial intelligence can&#8217;t always keep up!</em></p>\n<p>Hello Octalysis Primers, today we&#8217;re going to talk about another psychological fundamentals video. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">The Flow Theory</a>.</p>\n<p>So, as we are learning about the Octalysis framework and and how to apply that to our daily lives and gamification design we also go upstream and learn about different motivational psychology concepts and one of the most iconic that I haven&#8217;t talked much about, besides in the brief Udemy course, is the Flow Theory. And the Flow Theory is created by a famous psychologist, called Mikalyi Csikszentmihalyi.<br />One of the more challenging task and my job is to know how to pronounce his name. I&#8217;m still not confident that I spell his name really well without Google correcting my typing, but it is very influential for inspiring so I wanted to spend more time on it. I just want to talk about how the Flow Theory came about.</p>\n<p>So Mikalyi Czikscentmihalyi wants to understand how people are feeling and how happy they&#8217;re related to 20 or 30 years ago, gave a lot of students beepers, and basically they&#8217;ll just go about doing the things in their daily lives, and every once while the beeper will ring, and then they&#8217;ll be typing in what did they do, and how do they feel about it. <br />He realized that people are actually happier when they seem to be too challenging tasks, and they seem to be doing creative things. So he started writing about this concept called flow. Basically, flow state became one of the staples of psychology. And so basically, when a person enters the flow state, they lose a sense of time, they lose the sense of self. They&#8217;re so focused, and they feel happy, and they don&#8217;t like to be interrupted. That&#8217;s why a lot of times people say gamers are grumpy.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"904\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-30-08.47.25.png?resize=904%2C524&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15016\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-30-08.47.25.png?w=904&amp;ssl=1 904w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-30-08.47.25.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-30-08.47.25.png?resize=768%2C445&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Grumpy gamer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When people are in the flow state get interupted, they could get grumpy. By the way, of the beeper is called the Experience Sampling Method for your knowledge, but then even in this flow theory and talks about that there&#8217;s nine ways that we can achieve flow, at least in the original. <br />So first of all, through our bodies, which is dancing, self expression, but then later on 2008 he wants to make it very clear that there&#8217;s actually kind of a difference between something being pleasurable and enjoyable. Pleasurable sometimes involves things like sex or eating good food or whatnot and those tend to not bring you into the flow state per se.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then there&#8217;s things that are enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which make you go ah ha! I&#8217;m feeling challenged, creativity, and those actually make me feel in the flow state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So actually later on, he mentions that in terms of body it could be more on the pleasurable side and it may not necessarily lead to flow. But then he talked about how the mind gets into flow which is solving hard problems, we&#8217;re solving a problem that&#8217;s very difficult. We&#8217;re just really engaged, we haven&#8217;t given up yet we really think we have a chance.<br />Also, through our memories. He mentions that sometimes we are thinking about good memories in the past reliving that experience that can put you in a flow state too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also contemplating philosophical questions, so if you go to some of the Purpose videos in the Purpose Life Field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some are deep, or there&#8217;s no real answer but the exploration and the journey is the thing that is engaging part. A lot of times people end up being the flow state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He always talks about sometimes communication can lead people into the flow state. I don&#8217;t know if you experienced before where you startlingly spend time with a friend that you haven&#8217;t seen for a long time. You can talk for hours and three four or five hours go by. Sometimes I have a stay over with a friend. And we&#8217;ll just talk we&#8217;re just talking, talking, I&#8217;m tired and then it&#8217;s like five or six am and the sun is coming up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You feel really engaged in conversation with someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing is another one, you&#8217;re expressing yourself, your thoughts, and you also reach some type of flow state I would say when I write, I am pretty engaged and I&#8217;m in the flow state, all times right these days in the meeting a lot of videos but when I write, I actually enjoyed it immensely. <br />Lifelong learning can put you in flow, which I thought is very interesting right because other things are like short bursts lifelong learning is a long term thing but basically if you are learning throughout your life, every day you&#8217;re growing you&#8217;re learning, you actually are living in flow. And so, you feel happier you&#8217;re growing more and I think that&#8217;s what you guys are doing here in Octalysis Prime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s definitely here for the sake of lifelong learning application, Neil deGrasse Tyson, the famous astrophysicist he actually said that the way he sees purpose in his life, is that every day to learn something. And every one or two weeks, he tries to get his mind blown. So, That&#8217;s kind of achieving flow state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, Csikszentmihalyi talks about how potentially a job can be so satisfying, that if you believe the flow state especially if it is gamified, we talk about the components of that, how the job, bring you into the flow state. I think it does connect to some of the things earlier like solving for problems, things like that but as a separate thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally solitude would be the final way to achieve flow, being by yourself contemplating thinking, for me, maybe it&#8217;s designing that, actually, which is going to flow and meditating is for me just quiet meditating is painful and time goes by very very slowly so I&#8217;m definitely not in flow. What I&#8217;m just trying to have simple, but when I am seeking original thoughts, right just contemplating by myself, so many things. <br />So those are the ways that we can achieve flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, how do we know when flow has been achieved?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t all have to be there but he says number one is that the task is just a we believe that we can like I said something difficult right it is. It&#8217;s like, maybe not as hard. He talks about, we are able to focus all of our effort attention on the task so what&#8217;s going on here that it&#8217;s very very difficult to achieve that flow state. Remember I said when you are interrupted from flow, you actually feel grumpy so that means you are fully in attention, concentrating, you haven&#8217;t been interrupted. Right. <br />Number three is very interesting our goals are clearly defined, we know we&#8217;re trying to go for, and that pushing slow. The fourth is we received immediate feedback, which includes course correction so we know the goal, and we have direction we see feedback and we&#8217;re adjusting right. Obviously, that&#8217;s a lot of time how games are designed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the way a lot of games put people in the flow state. Now, I feel like some of it may not connect to some of the things we mentioned above, which is like sometimes we get philosophical questions you can say you&#8217;re trying to figure it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s feedback or say so I feel like, not all these things have a clear goal, even reliving memories I would say that isn&#8217;t a clear goal. These are not describing some of these experiences. And this is where we understand this intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation. Having a goal is a bit more <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-2-development-accomplishment/\">Development and Accomplishment</a>, dealing challenges is also Development/Accomplishment, having autonomy, giving people a sense of choice, that&#8217;s more intrinsic, right but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean we have flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think, with a goal of, you can achieve flow state but that&#8217;s not necessarily like all these components. They&#8217;re just identifying there&#8217;s patterns, and other components that are time spent on the task seem effortless to us, it&#8217;s not like grinding. It just flows right that&#8217;s what&#8217;s called the flow state. It just flows, feels natural if this harmonious. There&#8217;s no resistance to it we just feel like one with the universe and our tasks. And it&#8217;s just poetry even in a lot of the ancient Chinese martial art novels or whatnot, you know there&#8217;s a swordsman that he&#8217;s learning all these sorts of techniques, and then at one point, he just becomes one with a sword he doesn&#8217;t recognize that He exists in the sporting environment. He&#8217;s just being in this sword, waving poetry.</p>\n",

Don&#8217;t you WANT to be influenced and persuaded to do things you want to do? It feels good to be included in interesting, unusual, or fun events or gatherings. It piques your curiosity when a friend who knows you well sends you information or a book or a gift that makes your life better. And when your friends forget to invite you, you get upset.</p>\n<p>So, if you care about being influenced, then your friends do too. It&#8217;s part of our makeup as humans. We are nodes in social spheres of influence: individual to family to friends and society. And you are a node across many of these networks.</p>\n<h2>Understanding what Gamification is in the Context of Influence</h2>\n<p>Yu-kai likes to talk about\u00a0<a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-analysis/human-focused-design-better-term-gamification/\">human-focused design</a>. Your friends are very likely humans like you, so keep empathy toward your fallible friends forefront in your mind.</p>\n<p>Many of you have read <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/5-psychology-books-that-contextualize-gamification-design/\">Robert Cialdini&#8217;s &#8216;Influence&#8217;</a>\u00a0so you&#8217;re likely familiar with his six principles:</p>\n<p>-Reciprocity<br />\n-Commitment and consistency<br />\n-Social Prod<br />\n-Authority<br />\n-Liking<br />\n-Scarcity</p>\n<p>Many of you are also familiar with the Octalysis Framework, and can see how these concepts map onto the Octalysis octagon.</p>\n<p>-Reciprocity &#8212; <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-of-gamification-5-social-pressure-and-envy/\">Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness</a><br />\n-Commitment and consistency &#8212; <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-2-development-accomplishment/\">Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment</a><br />\n-Social Prod\u00a0&#8212; Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness<br />\n-Authority &#8212; Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness<br />\n-Liking\u00a0&#8212; Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness<br />\n-Scarcity &#8212; <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-6-scarcity-impatience/\">Core Drive 6: Impatience &amp; Scarcity</a></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of Core Drive 5! Though not exclusively.</p>\n<p>Now, notice how I&#8217;ve written this post so far: I did not start this discussion (in the introduction) with detailed list of why persuasion and influence work, or the benefits you&#8217;re likely to get. I simply started with a true example (how we all are and want to be persuaded to do things that are good for us). Once you were comfortable, I moved into well-understood theory, as written clearly about by an author you likely already know. Again, your cognitive effort in absorbing the 6 principles was probably quite low (especially since you act out those 6 principles every day even if you don&#8217;t name them). Then I connected these principles to the Octalysis framework, which you ALSO already have seen before. But now you&#8217;re starting to get creative and see possibilities.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s time to mention a few of the possibilities I saw. I&#8217;m going to approach an application of influencing my friends in the context of the Octalysis Framework with specific tactics we&#8217;re calling &#8220;Game Techniques&#8221; (called as such because Yu-kai first noticed these in various games he played growing up or in researching how they were getting players&#8217; attention).</p>\n<p>Here is the moment where I&#8217;m testing my authority (which I attempted to increase by writing the above words and transferring ideas I hope were relevant to you in the context of persuasion).</p>\n<h3>Game Technique #45: Thank-You Economy</h3>\n<p>Thank-You Economy is an environment of generosity and reciprocation.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re trying to have more influence in your friend group, you could try to be more generous and demonstrate increased reciprocation. Remember, people&#8217;s memories are strange. Sometimes we can&#8217;t let go of certain parts of ourselves or dark parts of the past. So if you&#8217;ve wronged someone, a single display of generosity won&#8217;t get them to trust you.</p>\n<p>Since reciprocation is a two-way street, you sometimes will need to ask a favor of your friends, so that YOU can reciprocate something they&#8217;ve done for you. Get it?</p>\n<h3>Game Technique #22: Group Quest</h3>\n<p>A Group Quest is an activity or series of activities that can only be completed in a group. Ideally, it will require consistency and commitment from all members. If you notice a Group Quest brewing among friends, why don&#8217;t you step up and lead it? If there is already a leader, why don&#8217;t you be the most helpful member of the party? Examples could be birthday party planning, side hustles, and college reunions.</p>\n<p>Pro tip: Remember to use Quest Lists and MiniQuests to keep all members of the party engaged.</p>\n<h3>Game Technique #62: Social Prod</h3>\n<p>Social prods are quick casual actions that establish a low commitment social engagement. Whether on social or via email or text or a quick word at a party (in person, smile, ask a good question and show interest), social prods work. Why? Because they demonstrate empathy and that you were thinking of the person. If you can use Social Prods when your friends aren&#8217;t expecting it, they will be more impactful and memorable.</p>\n<p>One thing I&#8217;m experimenting with soon is sending hand-written letters to my best friends and people who have influenced me. It&#8217;s true that a text is faster and can still show love. Even a short phone call can do the same.

At first I thought he was a populist (for getting votes) who is promoting Marxist socialism ($1000/mo Universal Basic Income). After reading his book I changed my mind and felt pretty good about him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few useful things to share to people who are unfamiliar:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. His UBI replaces (unless opted out) all welfare programs. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It reduces incentives to be in weak positions (unemployed and pretending to find jobs or divorcing etc) and shrinks government (no more complicated and long-winded approval process and checking if a person still qualifies every month)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. He says after that it\u2019s going to be still $1.3 Trillion below budget. He plans to get it via VAT (value add sales tax) that would optimize for luxury and AI driven items.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> Profitability from automation and GDP will rise dramatically, and we need to make sure machine profits don\u2019t screw over the hard working humans. He says that with a 10% VAT (20% for most non-US western countries), if one gets $12K more per year, people would only be worse off if they spend more than $120K per year. But Amazon has to pay taxes on transactions instead of just \u201cour accounting methods shows we don\u2019t need to pay taxes.\u201d Btw, he doesn\u2019t try to vilify Amazon as having evil agendas, but he says people will suffer due to optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. The rest he believes in trickle up economy. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people will spend most of the $1000/mo (most Americans needs to as they have less than $500 savings) and help other local businesses and income, as opposed to big government just keeping it and spending on inefficient large items in military and others. In Econ 1 we learn about the multiplier effect, where if $1000 passes through 5 people, 5 people made $1000 each and the GDP increases by $5000 (not counting taxes) and the government will get more taxes back too on each step.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. It may or may not be perfect calculations, but it\u2019s not wishful dreaming and promising. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>His policies page estimate costs for dozens of his policies and also how he expects them to be paid.&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yang2020.com%2Fpolicies%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1BnjwAJPMAJ5r7FtkVwizTrAtLCrc_I8rpIIliWVDy69-J7ZkIiKgpDyQ&amp;h=AT2P429pfXf4BDgcW47fq77AR5dTebv3npXhecLVlic4XbHHiH3LidzDrDflBr5L9wo1H4-e6baaz7z1afhjZj3oM-gWSlWd4JBj5N7epONwZiH4XlHfiO1m1sTSryDWNtG9i17XYeowsq9MUwMmJfYyHTEZLXZPujYy-gfkd4_0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.yang2020.com/policies/</a> I especially like the one where all field cops should have cameras on constantly to really resolve police brutality issues as everyone has better information and context.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. The automation crisis is happening now. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just look at empty malls closing because of Amazon (robots in their warehouses), self-checkout at groceries, casinos replacing bartenders this year, and Tesla launching autonomous fleet next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. UBI is different to socialism because..</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Traditional Socialism, it doesn&#8217;t matter how hard you work, everyone will have the same outcome. In Yang&#8217;s economy, if you consistently do the correct things and have a bit of luck, anyone can become a millionaire. UBI just makes sure that everyone has a few chips to participate in the game to begin with. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. $1000/mo is not going to solve all problems. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is just around the poverty line so if people could work they should want to (outside of outliers). But $1000/mo would make it easier for people to relocate for other opportunities, go back to school or be retrained, or decide to dedicate more time to raising their children. Also, rich people get $1000/mo too, because instead of the &#8220;F you rich people!!&#8221; narrative, it honors them by saying, &#8220;You will be paying significantly more taxes not from your wealth/income but on your luxurious enjoyment of American goods. But you will get your Freedom Dividend as a respected citizen of the United States, just like everyone else.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Trump won President because Americans in Middle States were hearing the awful narrative about White Privilege</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;about how white people get everything so easy and all America&#8217;s problems are coming from them; but yet they are struggling in the millions, losing their jobs to automation and failing to support their families. Strong man Trump shows up and says, \u201cthe media and democrats say YOU are the problem. You are what makes America bad. They don\u2019t care about you. Well guess what, you are not the problem. You are a victim, and I will fight back those jobs from those foreigners!\u201d When you are drowning, you grab on to whoever actually says will save you as opposed to those calling you the bad guy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. I\u2019ve met many people saying that when they voted for Trump they were looking for someone like Andrew Yang </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;someone who is concerned about their problems, not vilifying them, and ACTUALLY having a plan. These Middle State Americans don\u2019t need a big white man to be President. They just need someone who cares about their problems to be President.

In this fast moving environment, only the most adaptable will survive</h3>\n<p>Not looking at the recession that will eventually diminish, I believe that companies&#8217; talent acquisition and retention strategies will change completely due to the new career values of the Gen-Y.</p>\n<p>In the past, companies&#8217; often hire individuals that fit their culture, who are smart, and have lots of potentials. They invest time and money to train these individuals into future managers and eventually leaders of the firm.</p>\n<p><!--more-->However, since the general trend is that employees nowadays only stick with one company for a few years, it no longer makes economical sense for them to hire people who just have lots of potentials but needs further training to become a valuable warrior on the job.</p>\n<p>But who can blame these companies? Why would a company invest in thousands of dollars in training to make the perfect employee, just to lose her to its biggest competitors?</p>\n<p>Because of this &#8220;job-hopping&#8221; trend, companies will be forced to only hire people who already have all the skills, instead of one&#8217;s who can be trained for the job.</p>\n<h3>This means that when they hire you, they don&#8217;t want to develop your skills. They want to simply give you some instructions, and plug-and-play immediately.</h3>\n<p>What does this mean for the new generation looking for an awesome and meaningful career? It means that you need to make sure you are constantly developing new skills on your own in order to compete with others and become hire-able.</p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t rely on your school and companies to train you and make you a competitive talent</h3>\n<p>Take initiative and learn as much as you can. Utilize every single spare moment you have to make yourself a stronger character in the game of life.</p>\n<p>After all, you have 168 hours a week. A 40-hour job is not full-time. It&#8217;s not even quarter time. If you sleep for another 40 hours, you have 88 hours left in the week. Take advantage of that time and level up in whatever you do.</p>\n<p>To live an extraordinary life, you have to live every day of your life extraordinarily. If you live every day of your life like everyone else, you will end up like everyone else.</p>\n",

In 2019 I became a supporter of Andrew Yang, and remembered that my proposal ten years ago, while not as &#8220;complete,&#8221; was very similar. So I updated it a little bit and surfaced it back. Despite having a degree in Economics, I am NOT an expert on the economy but an expert on behavioral design and gamification)</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, I was exercising while listening to the Wall Street Journal This Morning about what the government is doing to save the economy. I have also been paying attention to how governments are giving grants to startups who can prove that they are very innovative.</p>\n<p>Having wrote a <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/society/save-economy-787-billion-stimulus-package/\">blogpost on this topic earlier</a>, I formulated what I think is a doable plan for the government to save the economy.</p>\n<p>For validation, I took this plan to two of my friends, one who is an ex-VC and Boston Consulting Group Consultant, and the other a Stanford University Researcher. They haven&#8217;t been able to poke holes in this theory *yet*, so I thought I would share it on my blog and hopefully I will find out the flaws in my thinking or it will get discovered by policy makers to really execute it through.</p>\n<h3>Foundations of my theory: nodes and 3 coefficients</h3>\n<p><strong>When the government throws money into the economy, it passes through many &#8220;nodes&#8221; (person or organization), and each node has three coefficients along with it: spend/save, innovation, and upside.</strong></p>\n<p><!--more-->This is using a tiny bit of my econometrics knowledge I obtained from my UCLA economics degree, but it should break down into fairly simple terms.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Spend/Save Ratio (Coefficient)</strong> means when people get money, how much of it do they spend, and how much of it do they save up. If they save up all the money once they receive it, then the economy will not improve (unless it gets invested into another business that has high spend/save ratio).</p>\n<p><strong>In times of uncertainty, people who are fairly wealthy will save money</strong>. The only people that will spend are low income earners that can barely afford their own living. These people are forced to spend all the money they have each month, boosting the economy forward, especially if they pay others who are low in income too.</p>\n<p>The SS Ratio is the deciding factor of how many &#8220;nodes&#8221; money passes through, making the other two coefficients more relevant.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Innovation Coefficient</strong> is how much innovation is driven as $ passes through an entity. Like what most corporations argue, innovation does not just include creative ideas but also includes implementation and market adaption.</p>\n<p>Some corporations spend hundreds of millions to launch an innovative product, while a startup creates a similar competing (sometimes better) solution after only spending one million dollars. The startup&#8217;s Innovation Coefficient is much higher as each dollar created more innovation.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <strong>Upside Coefficient</strong> is how much more money can each dollar potentially generate if it goes well. The startup world knows this concept well. A Venture Capitalist would invest in ten startups that all have a potential upside of $100M. Most of them would fail, but it only takes one success to cover the rest and more. Now if the upside of the businesses were $10M, then investing $5M into ten businesses makes no sense. It would invest $50M in total, and only 1-2 companies would return $10M each while the rest would die.</p>\n<p>The government needs to aim for a high upside value because their goal is to<strong> create thousands of jobs for each batch of money they throw into the economy.</strong></p>\n<h3>Optimize government spending by maximizing all three values and make sure there are many nodes</h3>\n<p><strong>Each dollar the government spends need to pass through as many nodes as possible with high coefficient values. </strong>So the formula pretty much goes: [$ * spend ratio * innovation * upside] for however many nodes there are until they all get saved up somewhere (and hopefully invested back into high Spend/Save Ratio entities in the US).</p>\n<p>Money that goes to a large research corporation might have high innovation value (0.8 or 0.9), but the upside coefficient would be lower (you rarely see corporations that make a product that generates 50x the investment but it happens commonly in the startup world) and it will usually get saved up by high-paid engineers/scientists that are uncertain about the economy.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, money that goes into a mom-and-pop stores will likely be all spent on covering costs, paying other low wage workers, and consumer spending at other mom-and-pop stores. There is still relatively low upside and innovation value to it though.</p>\n<h3>Pay entrepreneur salaries as a way to optimize economy recovery</h3>\n<p>Through this theory, my conclusion is that the best way to pump up an economy is to give grant-like salaries to sustain the lives of entrepreneurs (perhaps biased, but I sincerely think this is the best solution).</p>\n<p>The government can give entrepreneurs a VERY low amount of survival money, like $20,000 a year, as a salary to do entrepreneurial work. \u00a0<strong>This is useful because there are lots and lots of people who would be entrepreneurs but they couldn&#8217;t pursue their dreams due to realistic survival issues.</strong> They still have to raise their normal funding from investors and grow their business, but this plan allows them to pursue the innovation work they want without the fear of dying on the streets.</p>\n<p>Many entrepreneurs are some of the smartest and most creative people in the workforce, and they demand very little to survive. They also need to spend all $20,000 of that money because they don&#8217;t have the capacity to save.</p>\n<p>I tried it myself. $1200 a month is enough to cover subletting rent, cell phone bills, food money, $250 worth of monthly gas fees, and everything else I need. $20,000 a year is already a premium from that standpoint.</p>\n<p>And that generates over 80-100 hours a week of productivity (I worked 100 hours a week for years without any pay). If an entrepreneur is running a startup just to have a comfortable materialistic life, he is in the wrong profession.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs would also likely spend on other smaller and cheaper companies and employees that would need to spend most of their money too, passing through many nodes.</p>\n<p>Their innovation value is obviously also very high. I would argue that each dollar spent in a startup is more efficient in terms of innovation compared to a large company because they all try to do things the leanest way without the bureaucracy costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Again, a great talent working 80-100 hours a week on an innovative concept with $20,000 a year.</strong> Am I missing something here or is this the best deal an economy could ever have?</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, and most importantly, the idea about startups is that if it works, it could make millions in revenue and create a lot more jobs.</strong> Startups don&#8217;t raise money so they can make enough cash-flow to sustain their own lives. They raise money in the promise that if it works, the money put in would return a hundred fold, creating new jobs, new markets, wealthy investors, and new happy entrepreneurs.</p>\n<h3>Low spending, high payout</h3>\n<p>So with this plan, with $2M the government could support 100 entrepreneurs for one year (not even talking about the billions that are spent elsewhere saving dying companies). And if you have a good VC talent in terms of screening which startups have potentials, <strong>you just have to play the numbers game and statistically 10 of these startups would become successful and generate millions of revenue with thousands of jobs.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Now imagine if the government spent $200 Million on that instead.</span></p>\n<p>The beauty is that the other 90 entrepreneurs who fail hasn&#8217;t wasted the money either. They have produced some innovation in the economy, pushed forward valuable skill sets and experience in that field, and they would have spent all their money into circulation.</p>\n<p>Again, keep in mind that, in this plan, it is obviously up to the entrepreneur herself to figure out how to raise money, find talents and all that to grow the business, but at least her survival to be an entrepreneur is covered.</p>\n<p>Finally, this will definitely increase the entrepreneurial culture in the area. Entrepreneurs from other locations (if this is a city policy) might come just to apply for this program. It also encourages a lot of young talents to pursue this path right after college. Overall, it should be a win-win-win situation.</p>\n<p><strong>I truly believe that if the government implements this plan, there will be more spending, more innovation, and a lot more jobs created in the economy. Please help push this out to policy makers. I&#8217;m tired of this recession.</strong></p>\n<p>Update: I&#8217;ve received some criticism that this is like &#8220;welfare&#8221; for entrepreneurs and welfare is not efficent + the government should be hands off. I will argue that, in welfare systems, you pay people who are struggling to survive, and that&#8217;s it. In my plan, you are giving money to those who could create 1000 more jobs. One is more like a sympathy vote, whereas the other is more like investing into the future of the economy. I&#8217;d say if even 1% of the people the government supports on welfare can create 1000 more jobs, the economy would be MUCH MUCH better today.</p>\n",

Even the popular Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson dismisses this concept and makes fun of it. However, many Quantum Physicist now believe in this concept of consciousness affecting the physical world based on the evidence from experiments.</p>\n<p>Now, there are two type of doubters &#8211; lazy ones and diligent ones. Lazy is not a bad thing, but just means you doubt but you don&#8217;t want to spend a lot of time investigating. Diligent ones want to investigate a lot. I&#8217;ve made some argument sessions on both:</p>\n<h3>Lazy Doubters</h3>\n<p>Here I offer some higher level items, mostly in the form of social proof. This shows the credibility of people who believe in this consciousness concept. This is not &#8220;widely accepted&#8221; or &#8220;proven&#8221; in any way, but it is a legitimate theory that accomplishing scientists support.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;When the province of physical theory was extended to encompass microscopic phenomena through the creation of quantum mechanics, the concept of consciousness came to the fore again. <strong>It was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to the consciousness.</strong>&#8220;</em><br />\n\u2015Eugene Wigner, <strong>Nobel Prize Winner</strong> and leading Physicist of the Twentieth Century</p>\n<p><em>\u201cScience cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature.

As long as we measure the photon&#8217;s path before its arrival at a detector is finally registered, we lose all interference. <strong>It is as if nature &#8220;knows&#8221; not just if we are looking, but if we are planning to look.&#8221;</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Beginning in the 1980s, the British physicist Roger Penrose suggested that the link might work in the other direction. Whether or not consciousness can affect quantum mechanics, he said, <strong>perhaps quantum mechanics is involved in consciousness.&#8221;</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>This is Roger Penrose&#8217;s Credentials:</strong></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;Penrose is known for his work in mathematical physics, in particular for his contributions to general relativity and cosmology.

Below is his bio:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Campbell has had a long career as a scientist and physicist. He received a B.S. in Physics as well as an M.S. in Physics. His Ph.D. work specialized in Experimental Nuclear Physics with a thesis in low-energy nuclear collisions.\u00a0 Subsequently, he spent the better part of 30 years working within the U.S. missile defense community as a contractor to the\u00a0<a title=\"United States Department of Defense\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense\">Department of Defense</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-nasa_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_W._Campbell#cite_note-nasa-4\">[4]</a></sup>\u00a0Campbell most recently worked for\u00a0<a title=\"NASA\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA\">NASA</a>\u00a0within the\u00a0<a title=\"Ares I\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_I\">Ares I</a>\u00a0program (follow-on to the\u00a0<a title=\"Space Shuttle\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle\">Shuttle</a>) <strong>assessing and solving problems of risk and vulnerability to insure mission and crew survivability and success.&#8221;</strong><sup id=\"cite_ref-nasa_4-2\" class=\"reference\"></sup></p>\n<p>Some people doubt his credibility, but I dug deeper into Thomas Campbell\u2019s background as people said his background isn\u2019t verifiable and he just made it up.</p>\n<p>I finally found his credentials on the NASA website: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20090014192</p>\n<p>In the PDF that is attached there, it does verify that, \u201cTHOMAS W. CAMPBELL is currently consulting in the field of Probabilistic Design Analysis for NASA. He has over 36 years of experience working with the Department of Defense in several fields, including systems engineering; technology development; physics based modeling and simulation; algorithm and software development; intelligence analysis; radars, antenna, and electronic environments analysis; system security engineering; technology transfer, reuse, and insertion; engineering management and program management; and system risk and vulnerability. He received a B.S. in Physics as well as an M.S. in Physics. His Ph.D. work specialized in Experimental Nuclear Physics with a thesis in low-energy nuclear collisions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since his work with NASA is assessing and solving problems of risk and vulnerability to insure the Ares shuttle mission and crew survivability and success, I think there needs to be a lot of precision in his work, as opposed to being an idealistic philosopher.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>2.

As a result, I became a leading pioneer in the gamification space and am running many of the biggest gamification initiatives in the world (consulting company, the education platform <a href=\"http://www.octalysisprime.com\">Octalysis Prime</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/octalysis\">FB community</a>). It worked out quite well for me, and I live every day of my life as a passionate gamer. Even Blizzard has sent their game designers to my workshops to learn about the Octalysis Framework.</p>\n<p>But I sometimes can&#8217;t help but think about the other choice I didn&#8217;t make. If I chose to go down the esports path, I would also become an early pioneer in esports and today I may be running some of the largest esports infrastructure entities in the industry (I&#8217;m realistic enough to know that I wouldn&#8217;t become a pro-player myself). That would be tremendously fun too.</p>\n<h3>The two passions meet</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Octalysis-jersey-v10.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13604\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Octalysis-jersey-v10.png?resize=660%2C371&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gamification Esports Jersey\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Octalysis-jersey-v10.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Octalysis-jersey-v10.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Octalysis-jersey-v10.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Octalysis-jersey-v10.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/octalysis-hoodie-v2.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13603\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/octalysis-hoodie-v2.png?resize=660%2C371&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gamification Esports Hoodie\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/octalysis-hoodie-v2.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/octalysis-hoodie-v2.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/octalysis-hoodie-v2.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/octalysis-hoodie-v2.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Luckily, because of how strong my gamification efforts are doing, I suddenly have the unique opportunity to go down the path I didn&#8217;t take.</p>\n<p><strong>We have now sponsored a team in the Heroes of the Storm Global Championship (HGC), the premier Heroes of the Storm competitive league from Blizzard Entertainment.</strong> Our team &#8220;Team Octalysis&#8221;

(NASDAQ-TSLA) is the best &#8220;Angel Investment Opportunity&#8221;</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve often asked myself: why am I a Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA) bull, despite unimpressive financials (to say the least), sky-high valuation, and a seemingly unfocused CEO.</p>\n<p>If you look at the financials, things aren&#8217;t that great. Tesla in general is still losing lots of money (especially if you don&#8217;t count occasional Carbon Credit Tax Credit boosts). It still requires a TON more money to expand and operate. For some reason Elon Musk was already working on Giga Factories 3, 4, and 5, when Giga Factory 1 hasn&#8217;t even been completed and required more capital. The whole company&#8217;s success weighs on Model 3 and Tesla&#8217;s ability to suddenly mass produce cars that not even much larger automakers could do. Finally, growing competition in many other well established car brands are coming into the market and stealing Tesla&#8217;s pie.</p>\n<p>How does it make sense to invest in this company?</p>\n<h3>Tesla, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ-TSLA) and the Silicon Valley way</h3>\n<p>After pondering about this question for a while, I realized that the reason why I like Tesla, is that it is almost the most\u00a0<strong>conservative</strong> and strongest type of Angel Investment Deal one can find.</p>\n<p>In the past, I have made non-trivial money from Startups, and I know how things work in this world (many Venture Capitalists like to refer their portfolio companies to me for my help). When you look at Tesla, Inc as a public company value stock, it may not be that attractive. However, if you still see Tesla as a growth phase startup that requires capital to grow and can take over an entire industry, this is a huge opportunity. As an Angel Investor myself, I couldn&#8217;t give up on this opportunity.</p>\n<p>In the startup world, when we invest we mostly look at a few things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Team</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Traction</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Total Addressable Market Size</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Competition</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will explain in this post how Tesla fits the perfect pattern for all of the above. However, I first want to address one thing.</p>\n<h3>Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA)\u00a0does not lose money on every car sale</h3>\n<p>Many bears like to throw out the statement that &#8220;Tesla loses money on every car it sells.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is false.</p>\n<p>Tesla makes a margin on every car it sells. However, because it is so aggressively setting up new infrastructure and new R&amp;D, it ends up losing money. Let&#8217;s say you run a restaurant and invest $10,000 to put iPads on each table. Then say that each food item costs $1 but you can sell it for $11. After selling 900 of this food item, you would have made $9,000 in gross profits. However, since it does not cover the $10,000 investment towards new technology, you post a net loss of $1,000. <strong>This does not mean that you lose money on every food item you sell.</strong></p>\n<p>Even though the &#8220;Tesla loses money on every car it sells&#8221; term sounds fancy and catchy for bears, it is entirely inaccurate. If you are a bear for this very reason, I believe the risk you are taking is based on misinformed decision-making and would recommend reconsidering (of course, other reasons could still justify a bear thesis).</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, lets cover the fundamentals of startup investing for Tesla.</p>\n<h3>The Team\u00a0behind\u00a0Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA)</h3>\n<p>OK, so there are a lot of great talent behind Tesla, but for now I&#8217;m only going to cover Elon Musk for somewhat obvious reasons. For research on this, I have actually read his <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233\">whole biography</a>, so I may know more than the average bear about the entrepreneur behind the company.</p>\n<p>In startup investing, we look at whether the entrepreneur has successful past &#8220;exits&#8221; &#8211; meaning they made their investors a lot of money. Entrepreneurs who have big exits are hard to come by, and every angel investor wants to jump on that deal when the opportunity becomes present. Even if an entrepreneur has failed 8 times in the past, as long as they have 1-2 successful exits, they are considered gold and a worthy bet.</p>\n<p>Now the thing about Elon Musk is that, <strong>Elon Musk has NEVER had a failed venture</strong>. We all know about his successful endeavors at Paypal (sold to eBay for $1.5 billion) and SpaceX (being the third entity &#8211; behind the U.S. and Russian governments &#8211; to launch rockets into space at 10% the cost). Tesla itself of course is a successful example.</p>\n<p>Critics\u00a0might unfairly call Tesla a funding-sucking\u00a0Ponzi scheme, but\u00a0even if they believe Tesla is overvalued, it definitely HAS value. Tesla makes cars that people want to buy, and these people are willing to pay $100K for these cars. After the purchase, many say their next cars will be Teslas too.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s value. It may or may not be a $50 Billion company, but I&#8217;m sure everyone will agree it is at least a $1 Billion company. That means, irrefutably, Elon Musk is a successful entrepreneur with Tesla.</p>\n<p>Well, every successful entrepreneur must have many little failures before they turn big right? What a lot of people don&#8217;t know is that even Elon Musk&#8217;s first venture that most people have never heard about about (Zip2) was also sold to Compaq Computer for $307 Million. If any smart-smirky bear wants to call Elon Musk an incompetent executive, first ask themselves if they or someone they know and respect have created companies worth over $300 Million in the past &#8211; multiple times.</p>\n<p>Well, actually, Elon Musk does have one failed venture. When he was a boy he wanted to start an\u00a0arcade company in South Africa. But after getting all the prep work done, the venue required an adult to sign the paperwork, and his parents refused to. Perhaps Elon Musk is over his head in optimism after all.</p>\n<p><strong>I strongly believe if there was an opportunity to invest in a startup that is run by Elon Musk, every serious and experienced Angel Investor would rush to become part of that deal.</strong></p>\n<h3>The Traction behind\u00a0Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA)</h3>\n<p>The next thing a startup investor looks at is Traction. Traction blinds all eyes. Even if the investor has no idea why someone would use a nose-picking app, as long as you can tell him that\u00a0you have 5 million active users every month and its growing by 20% each week, he&#8217;ll give you money if he believes that can be sustained.</p>\n<p>Now, traction does NOT mean profitability. Traction means growth, demand, and product-market fit. It means that if investors put in more money, it will contribute to the business becoming more successful, as opposed to &#8220;figuring out how to get\u00a0the first customer.&#8221; Startup Investors actually don&#8217;t care about profits much, because all revenue generated should be put back into growth, R&amp;D, and expansion.</p>\n<p>Many Venture Capitalists actually call their portfolio companies that are just making decent profits the &#8220;walking dead,&#8221; because it makes enough money to sustain forever, but it will never grow fast enough to dominate an industry (and lead to an Exit).</p>\n<p>If you look at Tesla (and companies like Amazon &#8211; NASDAQ: AMZN), they have traction. The Model S was a big success. People not only buy it, they rave about it. It receives huge (or ewwge) reviews. Model X &#8211; while having some operational issues due to complexity in vendors &#8211; is also a product that people want and are willing to pay for. Model 3 has over 400,000 people putting in $1000 deposits to say they want the car. I think there is no denying that Tesla has traction.</p>\n<p>Now the question is whether Tesla can service that demand. Well, let me just say that startup investors LOVE to jump on deals where the\u00a0demand is too high but they don&#8217;t have enough capital to supply the product. The traction is there, and if money can help deliver value to the demand, money is well invested.</p>\n<h3>The Market of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA)</h3>\n<p>So sometimes you would have a great entrepreneur with great traction, but there isn&#8217;t a big market anymore, or perhaps it has been &#8220;tapped out.&#8221; For instance, you could say Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) has a successfully proven CEO, and great traction. However, you could argue that Twitter has already acquired most of its market, and it is unrealistic for it to get another 50% more users. That puts a limit to the stock. Some people believe that Tesla has already tapped out the Electric Vehicle market, but I think that is extremely far from the truth.</p>\n<p>We are only at the beginning the EV Market. More and more people are moving toward hybrids and EVs, not necessarily because they care about the planet, but because they like the cars better. Many people like how fast the cars can accelerate. Many people like how quiet it is. Others like the feeling of never needing to go to a gas station as long as they can charge at home (growing startups like <a href=\"http://filld.com/\">Filld (a former client of mine)</a>\u00a0are there specifically to address this need by sending gas trucks to fuel your car where it is parked). A great amount of EV buyers and Tesla owners say they will buy the same thing again.</p>\n<p>This market is only growing at a rapid pace and not shrinking. Even for those who don&#8217;t believe in global warming, we know that smog in a city is undesirable. Beijing and Los Angeles are filled with smog and you could barely see the sunrise. Reduced emissions has many appeals that is seen and felt.</p>\n<p>The only two barriers to adopting more EV&#8217;s are 1) Pricing and 2) Range Anxiety. People often can&#8217;t afford the EV&#8217;s that can give them over 300 miles per charge (even in the $30,000 range). There is no doubt in my mind the cost and range of EV&#8217;s will dramatically decrease in the future years to come, removing those barriers. When those barriers are being slowly lifted, I believe that we currently are not even at 10% the market capacity for EVs in the future world.</p>\n<p>Another thing to remember is that Tesla is also not just a car company. <strong>It is an ENERGY company.</strong> This is why it is not unfathomable that Tesla can grow to become bigger than Ford or GM. Its addressable market includes the car industry, solar panels industry, and energy industry. Here I point out some opportunities in the solar panels and energy industry.</p>\n<h3>Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA)\u00a0will dominate in Solar\u00a0Energy</h3>\n<p>The Solar City acquisition was questionable to many people. The valuation of it might be high, and the cash situation isn&#8217;t that stellar either. However, it is still a dominating player in the solar industry. If you believe a lot more organizations will use solar panels in the future, then is makes sense to bet on the biggest companies in that space. I don&#8217;t think many people are &#8220;against&#8221; solar energy. The only barrier for people to have it is: 1) integration hassles &#8211; too lazy to investigate or roof too small 2) cost to implement.</p>\n<p>As we know from Behavioral Science (which happens to be what I&#8217;m good at), we often don&#8217;t want to make big changes to our behavior until we see our neighbors do the same thing. I believe as more and more people get solar panels, it will only create a ripple effect in driving up demand.</p>\n<p>However, the key is that the cost and installation process of solar panels would become a lot easier. As Elon Musk said,</p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s looking quite promising that a solar roof will actually cost less than a normal roof before you even take the value of electricity into account. So the basic proposition would be, &#8216;Would you like a roof that looks better than a normal roof, last twice as long, cost less and by the way generates electricity?&#8217; Why would you get anything else?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, there are comments about the &#8220;cheaper cost&#8221; is compared to more expensive roofs, and not the asphalt ugly ones. Besides the fact that Tesla is addressing wealthier families anyway as his target market, I believe over time, the cost would still become lower and lower, eventually being affordable for more households. Betting on this is betting on minimum linear advancement of the human race. I&#8217;m in on that bet.</p>\n<h3>Every power outage crisis is an opportunity for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA)</h3>\n<p>Beyond the car and solar part of Tesla&#8217;s business, another huge potential is its energy and battery business. For this industry, the sky is the limit. You may already know that the State of Hawaii has already deployed 272 Tesla power packs and is expected to save\u00a0them 1.6 million gallons of diesel fuel annually. South Australia had a total black out, and immediately they pursued the opportunity to work with Tesla on providing 24/7 power no matter what the condition.</p>\n<p>Do you know what that means? It means that every time there is a power outage, that becomes an opportunity for Tesla (luckily, these &#8220;crisis opportunities&#8221; don&#8217;t have to cost people lives). The weeks prior to this writing, San Francisco and Fremont both had a power outage, causing the BART public transportation system to stop functioning, as well as the traffic lights of the already-hectic San Francisco streets. People are talking about how the government needs to buy Tesla products to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen again. It would be crazy to not see this as a great line of growing business (especially when the buyers are big pocket governments).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately and fortunately, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said to investors, &#8220;At this time, we ascribe zero value to Tesla shares from this business.&#8221; To me. this just means untapped upside potentially not factored into the stock.</p>\n<h3>Competition expands market for\u00a0Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA)</h3>\n<p>Another big critique is that the competition will suddenly burst ahead and steal Tesla&#8217;s lunch. Many startups as well as large companies like GM, Audi, and Porsche are all launching long range EV&#8217;s that people would want to buy. <strong>In the startup world, that is actually not a problem, AS LONG AS the company stays innovative AND the market is expanding fast.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, I believe EV is going to become more and more dominant in the future (you can see that the people that first endorsed online shopping are the ones that are first endorsing EV&#8217;s &#8211; early adaptors of a new trend). Often when you have a &#8220;new&#8221; market, it takes a lot of time and investment to &#8220;educate the market&#8221; and generate demand. When the competitors come in, they will also spend considerable (and even more) amount of effort and advertisement to educate the market.</p>\n<p>Those critics who used to say, &#8220;EV&#8217;s will never be picked up by serious car companies and consumers. Tesla will die,&#8221; (this was not that long ago) &#8211; suddenly are being shut down. Now they are saying, &#8220;See, everyone major car manufacturer are doing EV&#8217;s. Tesla will die.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Consumers who are not sure about the viability and attractiveness of EV&#8217;s are suddenly seeing respectable companies telling them that it is okay and even good to get EV&#8217;s. I believe since the market is so untapped, having competitors come in only expands the market.</p>\n<p>This leads to the 2nd point:</p>\n<p>Can Tesla continue to innovate in this growing market? My answer is yes. Many of the serious car companies are trying to chase after what Tesla accomplished 5 years ago. Many of them say they will launch a competitive EV by 2020. By then, Tesla would continue to be 5 years ahead, and the competitors would have more copying work to do.</p>\n<p>This is common in the startup world. A Startup does something cool, and is ignored by the big companies. After the startup proves to become a &#8220;threat,&#8221; big old giant company spends 4 months of executive meetings to decide they want to do something similar. And after 2 years, they launch a product that is about 70% as good as the first product they were trying to copy. The 2 years allows the young startup&#8217;s lifespan to DOUBLE, becoming way better than what the giants copied. As a result, many large companies buy small startups just to shut them down.</p>\n<p>Tesla continues to invest in innovation. This is why it does not turn a profit. It wants to always be 5 steps ahead when others are playing catchup. Other car companies might get a tremendous amount of sales and become very successful. But would this stop the growing market from buying Tesla cars? I don&#8217;t think so. I have seen enough of this same pattern to be willing to bet my money on it.</p>\n<h3>Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA) will require more fundraising, and true investors are willing to fund it</h3>\n<p>Another big critique on Tesla&#8217;s stock is that they continuously need new rounds of capital raising, diluting the stock. <strong>In the startup investment world, people who are extremely worried about dilution due to future rounds are often unseasoned.</strong></p>\n<p>The very meaning\u00a0of raising investment money is\u00a0that a company can take the money and create more value than the amount\u00a0received. If a company raises $100 because it can generate $1000 in value after, the $100 is a no-brainer.</p>\n<p>The only question is, do people believe that the extra capital raised can contribute to more or less value than the received amount? If the capital raising for Tesla is only to do random unproven things that may or may not result in a return, that could be questionable. However, if we know that Tesla has 400,000 deposits and needs to invest in gigafactories to deliver to the demand, or to continuously stay innovative, it is not crazy to believe that the money invested would result in much higher value growth for the company.</p>\n<p>But, what about the dilution? It&#8217;s great that Tesla is taking new money and becoming more valuable, but I&#8217;m being diluted so it must be bad right?</p>\n<p>Well, the key is this:</p>\n<p>If Tesla raises a lot more capital\u00a0and you are diluted by 30%, but Tesla is able to take the capital raised and increase the value of the company by 150%, then suddenly the value of your stock actually went up significantly. In the startup world, we know that if you own 10% of a $9 Million company (so $900K in equity), and suddenly it raised another $1 Million, yes your allocation of the company&#8217;s equity is diluted by 11%, but you now own 9% of a $10 Million company, which is still $900K in equity.</p>\n<p>The simple breakdown is that, if a $9 Million company raises $1 Million, it&#8217;s new value is at the minimum $9 Million + the $1 Million cash raised. If the company has an extra $1 Million in the bank, it of course is at least $1 Million more valuable than before. If you believe the $1 Million raised would generate more than $1 Million in value due to clever investments (by an intelligent leader &#8211; see above), then each dilution round is actually a gain for your investment.</p>\n<h3>Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA) investors are motivated by Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</h3>\n<p>So I am known for my work in gamification and behavioral design. Among the 8 Core Drives of my creation the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/octalysis\">Octalysis Framework</a>, there is a motivation driver called Epic Meaning &amp; Calling.</p>\n<p>This means that people are taking an action\u00a0because they feel like they are part of something bigger than themselves. When people are driven by Epic Meaning &amp; Calling, they tend to commit seemingly irrational behaviors, often asking how can they become self-sacrificial to fulfill the bigger vision.</p>\n<p>While I am a Tesla Bull, there are times where I increase my ownership if I know the consumer market will push it up more, and I get rid of many shares when I feel that the shorts would suddenly decide to double down. I&#8217;ve made quite a decent profit (mid to high double-digits) from that. However, often times when I feel like Tesla is stretched too high and is going to have a strong correction based on some one-off bad news, I&#8217;m often surprised that the stock doesn&#8217;t drop as much as I thought it would.</p>\n<p>That is because Tesla investors are driven by Epic Meaning &amp; Calling. Often times, it doesn&#8217;t matter what happens, or what the numbers say, there are Tesla investors (myself not included) who would still own the stock and even double down on the dips. People believe in Elon Musk and his mission, whether it is to go to Mars or populate the world with EVs. Because of that, they are not the type of investors that scurry away when bad news hits. This makes me feel very comfortable as I am riding\u00a0the growth.</p>\n<p>No matter what happens to the Tesla stock or the company, there is a whole army of people passionate about the cause to back it and keep the stock high. If\u00a0Tesla ever gets to the point where they may risk bankruptcy due to their aggressive expansion plans, there will still be people waiting to fund it. And as mentioned above, raising new money and being diluted is a good thing I happily experience as long as I still believe the executive team remains competent.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion: Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA)\u00a0is still NOT a startup investment</h3>\n<p>Now given the arguments above, Tesla is still not a real startup investment. Even though it has significantly less risk, it also has much lower upside (we won&#8217;t be seeing 50x returns in five years). Also, it is definitely a lot riskier than a regular value stock play. I would not recommend people to bet their life savings on Tesla.</p>\n<p>There is still probability\u00a0where Tesla never fulfills its super ambitious mission and ends up dying (even Elon Musk admits that). But to those who have some extra money and are thinking about investing in startups, I would say that Tesla is one of the best bets out there. In addition, Tesla\u00a0also has a lot more liquidity than real startup investments as you can enter and exit at will as a public company&#8230;for now.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I find Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ-TSLA) a great hybrid investment that is less risky than investing in actual startups, but has a tremendous amount of upside compared to most public stocks. The public investors that have no idea/experience investing in startups do not understand how startup investing works, and therefore creates an opportunity for the rest of us who do.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: Ummm&#8230;.I&#8217;m LONG Tesla?</p>\n<h3></h3>\n",

If you&#8217;re ready to take the next step in your journey and truly transform your life with a passionate community, Octalysis Prime is the ultimate place to be.</p>\n<p>If you have been wondering why Yu-kai himself hasn&#8217;t been sharing more advanced content here on this blog in the past 6 months, it is because he has been dedicating all his time preparing for today&#8217;s launch for\u00a0<a href=\"http://join.octalysisprime.com/op-so/\">his ultimate Gamified Learning Platform: Octalysis Prime.</a></p>\n<p>For today&#8217;s launch, Yu-kai has already created over 300 exclusive educational videos, a gamified platform that tracks your Core Drives growth while unlocking new powers, and a direct way to connect with him via regular Office Hours.</p>\n<h3><strong>Everything Yu-kai Chou has Learned</strong></h3>\n<p>Since Yu-kai&#8217;s goal is to pass on the entirety of his knowledge via a Gamified Platform, Yu-kai will cover everything from the most advanced knowledge in Gamification Design (he was elected #1 Gamification Guru by top organizations multiple times), Behavioral Science (the backing of his Octalysis Framework), Entrepreneurship (Yu-kai has started many companies with industry-recognized successes), and living life effectively (Gamifying Productivity, Wellness, Education).</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"lp-pom-text-302\" class=\"lp-element lp-pom-text nlh\">\n<h3><strong>Exclusive educational videos not available anywhere else</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div id=\"lp-pom-text-304\" class=\"lp-element lp-pom-text nlh\">\n<p>Watch hundreds of educational videos developed by Yu-kai Chou at your own time and pace. As you watch the videos, various Core Drives will grow and unlock new powers within Octalysis Prime (ranging from Leveling Up Faster, Opening the Daily Chest more than once a day, to lowering your monthly payments by 40%!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Feedback-Widget-Action.gif?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12748\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Feedback-Widget-Action.gif?resize=1011%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Octalysis Feedback Companion\" width=\"1011\" height=\"800\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"lp-pom-text-324\" class=\"lp-element lp-pom-text nlh\">\n<h3><strong>Connect personally with Yu-kai Chou</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div id=\"lp-pom-text-325\" class=\"lp-element lp-pom-text nlh\">\n<p>Companies pay tens of thousands of dollars to invite Yu-kai to speak to their employees and get their questions answered.

Then join the Office Hours with Yu-kai Chou that are held multiple times a month during convenient times for members located all over the world.</p>\n<p>During Office Hours, Yu-kai answers personal questions of his past and lessons learned, gives advice on member work or personal project/decisions, looks at designs and interfaces while sharing how to improve the user experience. Everything corporate clients get during Paid Consulting would be covered in Office Hours.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"lp-pom-text-334\" class=\"lp-element lp-pom-text nlh\">\n<p><strong>Slack Yu-kai Chou some questions</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"lp-pom-text-336\" class=\"lp-element lp-pom-text nlh\">\n<p>Prefer chat over video?

However,\u00a0<strong>we already have 200 vibrant members in the community with over 300 educational videos created</strong>\u00a0(I put A LOT of time into this&#8230;and I&#8217;m still creating 2-3\u00a0videos a week!).</p>\n<p>Many members have even\u00a0<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/232186453\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://vimeo.com/232186453\">found dream jobs</a>\u00a0(working at The Octalysis Group, Music Educational Company, Accenture, and more) with the support of Octalysis Prime.</p>\n<p>I want this to be a truly transformative experience &#8211; <strong>so every member can look back at their Pre-OP days and wonder how they managed to get by without the knowledge, skills and connections </strong>(not to mention passion) that they now take for granted.</p>\n<p>And none of this is possible without you.</p>\n<p>You are the reason why I could do this. With you on board, we are literally\u00a0making history in the Gamification and Education Platform Industries. Lives will\u00a0become better and societies improved because of it (I am not using a hyperbole &#8211; I&#8217;ve already seen it happen!) For this, my entire team and I thank you for it.</p>\n<p>Even though Octalysis Prime is a $50/mo experience (MUCH lower than tuition for any college course but potentially much more impactful), I believe it will be a transformative investment for you. Out of all the investments available (including Bitcoin!), investing in YOURSELF is the only way to guarantee Lifelong Returns and Dividends. (For instance, there are a few books that I read that helped me or my company make AT LEAST $100K &#8211; $200K more&#8230;and that knowledge will keep on applying for the next 50 years!)</p>\n<p>So here is my invitation to enjoy the Island experience. Learn as much as you can from my educational videos. Bond with as many members as you can in the Slack Community, and see your life transformed into breakaway\u00a0success.</p>\n<p>I hope you have the Most Epic 2018 Imaginable. With Octalysis Prime, I will be there alongside your journey.

Our System 1 immediately knows it is a multiplication problem and that we could likely solve it. Our system 1 would also know what is probably too high or too low. But we wouldn\u2019t know for sure if 568 is correct or not. We have to CHOOSE to engage our System 2 to start solving the problem.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>P20</div>\n<div>System 1 and System 2 terminology come from psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>P23</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind to anything else. When we are focusing on a difficult task of tracking people wearing white shirts from black shirts, we miss a gorilla costume person walking in front of the screen. This is demonstrated in Chabris and Simons&#8217; book The invisible gorilla and demonstrated by Netflix Brain Game.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>P24</div>\n<div>The counting task and the instruction to ignore the other team causes this. 50% of the people don&#8217;t see it, and would not believe at all they would miss something so obvious.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>When a lot of resources are allocated to system 2, our system 1 becomes less effective.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>&#8220;We can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.&#8221;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>System 1 usually makes suggestions to System 2, and System 2 is in low effort mode and agrees to the intuition or impression. This then becomes belief.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>When System 1 cannot solve and issue, System 2 then becomes highly engaged.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>P25</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>System 2 keeps up polite when angry, and focused when driving at night. System 1 makes way more decisions but usually System 2 has the final say if it bothers.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>System 1 usually works quite well, and it cannot be turned off. It is working all the time.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>P26</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Sometimes System 1 and 2 have a conflict, such as saying the text &#8220;right&#8221; is on the left. We may still identify those correctly, but we need to slow down to properly do it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>P27</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The famous Muller-Lyer illusion shows 2 lines, one with fins pointing outwards and one with find pointing inwards. If we have seen it, our system 2 knows as a fact that the lines are equal length, but our system 1 will continue to let us see that one line is longer than the other. We cannot unsee the longer line, but we have learned to mistrust it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Sometimes there are cognitive illusions (instead of just visual). If a patient tells a doctor that every doctor in the past has screwed them over, but you are different. Run away from this patient, even though system 1 wants to help him. The strong sympathetic attraction to the patient is like the lines with fin &#8211; it is an illusion and our system 2 should learn to distrust it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Yu-kai&#8217;a note: the patient actually effectively used CD5: Social Influence, CD7: Curiosity on this disease, CD3 for the doctor to see if he can solve the problem that no one else can, CD 4: Identity in the sense of &#8220;I am that uniquely good doctor that cares about patience&#8221; and even CD1: Calling, &#8220;it&#8217;s my life mission to cure people, especially those who are mistreated by others&#8221;. No wonder even doctors cannot resist this!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>P28</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>We cannot turn system 1 off, but it is impractical to always be vigilant of these cognitive illusions. The best we can do it recognize situations that these errors are more prone to happen, especially when stakes are high.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>P29</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The reason why we name systems 1 &amp; 2 as characters is because it is more memorable to the Brain than abstract academic terms. Character and personalities are more memorable.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Yu-kai notes: this is adding CD5 to create more relatedness with the concept.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>P30</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Author gives some ways to use his concepts in everyday conversation at the end of each chapter, such as, &#8220;This is your System 1 talking. Slow down and let your System 2 take control.&#8221;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Yu-kai notes: While it is a bit geeky and only helpful among people who have this studied, this is a good example of CD3: Empowerment. The author immediately allows users to see how they can strategically USE these concepts in everyday conversations, perhaps sounding smarter and grasping the concepts better as a result.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>To join an international group of professionals learning gamification and human-focused design, join <a href=\"https://octalysisprime.com/become-a-member/\">Octalysis Prime</a>.</div>\n",

It was my first time visiting Europe, and it was a huge blast.</p>\n<p>It was a pretty difficult speech to do, since originally this talk was a 5-hour workshop, and I had to shrink it to a 17 minute talk. Not only that, I had to include a bunch of videos and fun things to share to make it dynamic. Of course, a TEDx talk is more like a brochure instead of a manual. The goal of a brochure is to get people to want to learn more. Therefore, a lot of the deeper knowledge, including Level II and Level III Octalysis couldn&#8217;t be covered, but I had to make it fun.</p>\n<p>Little known fact &#8211; I said the first sentence incorrectly, and for the first minute I was simply trying to recover from that. Usually I just intuitively do my talks with my slides, but TEDx asked me to memorize my lines and rehearse with them a few times. I was all ready to go, but then when I was onstage, the lighting was MUCH stronger than I expected. It threw me off and I uttered the sentence wrong. It was supposed to be, &#8220;Imagine a world where WORK is obsolete &#8211; where LABOR is a thing of a past.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Imagine a world where LABOR is&#8230;&#8221; and then I felt sad. It took me 1-2 minutes to pick myself back up again and be on my flow again. I always wonder if the talk would have been more successful if I maintained strong energy from the very beginning. Of course, we would never know.</p>\n<h3>Successes in Gamification after the Gamification TEDx Talk</h3>\n<p>Since then, I published <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/books\">my book Actionable Gamification</a>, and have won two Gamification Guru of the Year awards by the Gamification World Congress. Many fans, book readers, and clients have contacted me after watching that talk. I am grateful how much this talk has\u00a0contributed to my accomplishments today.</p>\n<p>Thank you TEDx, thank you Lausanne, and thank you Switzerland.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

What many people don\u2019t realize is that they are more than likely making one very common mistake that is actually a detriment to these very goals. </span></p>\n<p>Keeping in mind that people are drawn to visually pleasing images, the one thing that will make people click away from (or not click at all!) your page is posting images (or links, videos, etc.) that are blurry or grainy. Perhaps you think that since you invested in a high quality camera, your images should be more than sufficient. More than likely, however, you are making this very common mistake: you images are not correctly sized.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, if you ignore Facebook\u2019s recommended dimensions when posting images, links or videos, your content may be pixelated or cut off. Here is how to avoid these pitfalls.</span></p>\n<h3>Facebook Profile and Cover Photos</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with the Facebook profile photo and cover photo, since these are arguably the bread and butter of Facebook. Facebook photos should be sized at 180x180px while cover photos should be 828x315px. What about images, links or videos, you ask? Indeed, these have their own set of recommended dimensions, which should be 1200x630px, 1200x627px and 1200x675px respectively.</span></p>\n<h3>Other Dimensions on Facebook</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dimensions for posts and ad dimensions will differ yet again depending upon the nature of the content. Images should be 1200x900px while links and videos should be 1200x628px and 1200x675px respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure that your text is not over 20% and that your videos do not exceed 4 GB. Thumbnails also differ in size. For page post images and links, thumbnails should be 254x133px. Thumbnails for page post videos should be 254x143px. Lastly, there is a set of dimensions that govern page post events or page post like ads. Events should be 1200x44px while event responses should be 1920x1080px.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.techwyse.com/blog/infographics/facebook-cheat-sheetsize-and-dimensions/\">Here is the original source.</a></p>\n",

We are making the jump from identifying the 8 Core Drives of motivation to using them to build experiences.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>&#8216;Synergy&#8217; always makes me think of business school applications (I&#8217;ve helped a few friends edit theirs). But it is a real thing.</p>\n<p>Google defines synergy like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For Octalysis, synergetic motivation simply means\u00a0<strong>any time multiple motivations&#8211;any of the 8 Core Drives&#8211;are at work at the same time.</strong></p>\n<p>As you\u00a0build your own projects and products, or dissect what\u00a0<em>isn&#8217;t</em> working on the same, we will want to pay attention to potential for synergies and drawbacks of them, like situations where our <strong>Player\u00a0</strong>might have multiple motivations but we&#8217;re only catering to one of them in the design and thus failing to reach the\u00a0<strong>Desired Action</strong>.</p>\n<p>As always, we&#8217;ll use the <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-video-course/beginners-guide-gamification-3-90-games-fun-addicting/\" target=\"_blank\">8 Core Drives</a> in this\u00a0analysis.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>In the wild (Twitter)</h2>\n<p>Of course, we do see chains of motivation working in the wild. Consider Twitter.</p>\n<p>If I notice something worthwhile and comment on it, I stand the chance to receive likes and retweets (or quotes) and replies from followers or people tracking the same news.</p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m first, I stand to receive more repeat exposure than if I join the conversation later (unless I&#8217;m adding value or a new line of thinking, perhaps a humorous quip about the type of responses that are popular at the moment).</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s happening here?</p>\n<p>Essentially, Twitter is playing into my CD3 (to create a tweetable added-value comment about something in under 140 characters-CD6 response), CD2 and CD5 motivations to achieve that and get recognition from peers and the world. How much response I get is unexpected, CD7. If I don&#8217;t comment, I&#8217;ll miss out on that recognition, <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/behavioral-design/anti-core-drives/\" target=\"_blank\">Anti Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance</a> (having a great idea and passing on it).</p>\n<h2>Stacking Motivation, or Combos</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see what is happening motivationally in the above example, but it isn&#8217;t clear that Twitter designed for this or if it was an emergent behavior. Think back to the beginning. Twitter was very simple. A 140-character text-based one-to-many broadcast communication system.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to give an example of how to\u00a0<em>design</em> a multiple-motivation interaction.</p>\n<h2>The Bandwagon Streak</h2>\n<p>Earlier this week in Octalysis Prime Office Hours, Willow Neilson (OP member) asked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I notice some Game Techniques and Core Drives can be combined in chains. Do you have any general suggestions for some natural affinities or commonly occurring combinations?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yu-kai led into this conversation that most of his Tier 7 combos come from deep analysis with clients. It&#8217;s hard to generalize how to create these because any experience design starts with understanding who the\u00a0<strong>Players</strong> are and what the\u00a0<strong>Win States\u00a0</strong>are.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Bandwagon Streak</strong>, according to Yu-kai, is a Tier 7 game technique (very powerful!).</p>\n<p><em>You need to be a member of Octalysis Prime to view the below video, so continue below with the article \ud83d\ude42\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>https://octalysisprime.com/lesson/bandwagon-streak-gt-95/</p>\n<p>Before going into a generic example, let&#8217;s imagine there are two types of ways to earn points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Performance-driven</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Labor-driven</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Think back to the Twitter example. The quality and timing of my tweet (performance-driven) will garner more retweets.</p>\n<p>If I spam the same hashtag (labor-driven), it won&#8217;t help me gain influence or reach. (People are incentivized to &#8216;game&#8217; the system without quality and meaning.)</p>\n<h4>Bandwagon Streak Tagging Example</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot-2017-01-11-13.16.14.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9291\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot-2017-01-11-13.16.14.png?resize=660%2C289&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot-2017-01-11-13.16.14.png?resize=1024%2C448&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot-2017-01-11-13.16.14.png?resize=300%2C131&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot-2017-01-11-13.16.14.png?resize=768%2C336&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot-2017-01-11-13.16.14.png?w=1688&amp;ssl=1 1688w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you are a men&#8217;s clothing brand trying to encourage your community or customers to tag your clothing on Instagram with a few choice hashtags you know will help bring additional exposure.</p>\n<p>This could be a moment to implement a\u00a0<strong>Bandwagon Streak</strong>.</p>\n<p>You might start by rewarding your customers with additional discounts for tagging pictures featuring your clothing on Instagram (with the customer wearing them).</p>\n<p>If you applied a labor-driven reward structure where tags earn points&#8230;and if points are valuable, people will tag quickly without thought to how they approach. Because they aren&#8217;t adding value, they\u00a0also won&#8217;t feel proud.</p>\n<p>However, if we apply a performance-driven approach (more likes and comments on your posts the better), we can give help the customers take an insightful action (inspiring creativity). The customer will think carefully about how to present themselves on Instagram and use the hashtag creatively. This is still mostly CD2 (accomplishment) but layering some CD3.</p>\n<p>Next, we could layer in a\u00a0<strong>Magnetic Cap</strong>. This isn&#8217;t strictly possible on Instagram, but you could create a system (using a community manager), to only &#8220;count&#8221; the first 3 posts from any user/customer on Instagram for the period of the promotion. This effectively limits posts to 3x per day.</p>\n<p>This cap will make people think carefully before making their 3 posts. You could grant people a larger cap once they reach certain success metrics (likes and comments or click-throughs to your merchandise on your menswear site). Success breeds success.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s add some scarcity next via a <strong>Booster.</strong>\u00a0Limit the submission period to a single day, 24 hours. At the end of the period, the customer can no longer add posts\u00a0<em>unless</em> they bring in one more customer and that customer credits them for informing them about the post.</p>\n<p>This is a CD5 design because friends will be brought into the campaign.</p>\n<p>In the final hour of anyone&#8217;s period, you could add a register element (to your newsletter to your premium clothing line) for an additional\u00a0<strong>Booster</strong>.</p>\n<p>These limitations (CD6) help the customer be more precise in order to reach the Win-State. Of course, as the menswear company, you will be gaining user-generated content to share down the line in addition to the short-term buzz and newsletter signups.</p>\n<h4>The result?</h4>\n<p>Customers stay in their creative mode longer, post more pictures of themselves with your product, get discounts to future purchases, help to build word of mouth, and get signed up to your premium clothing line newsletter. This was only possible because we thought about why our customer might want to be motivated to do this and how to boost that experience and loop the <strong>Desired Actions</strong> if possible toward additional\u00a0<strong>Win-States </strong>(for the customer and the menswear company).</p>\n<h2>What are you seeing in the wild?</h2>\n<p>There are numerous examples of synergetic motivation and many ways to stack techniques into combos that create loops of attention and effort (maybe even flow!) from the\u00a0<strong>Player</strong>.</p>\n<p>If this is new to you, start by noticing situations where multiple motivations led you to seek an action.</p>\n<p>If you can pinpoint them, then ask: did the design of this experience cater\u00a0to each of these motivations, or just one of them?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Are you watching the #askgaryvee show or Dailyvee? Getting increasingly popular with entrepreneurs, Gary has found a winning formula to hook us to his content. It goes beyond simply being &#8216;good content&#8217;. What makes his stuff so addictive?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article, we analyze the emotions and feelings Gary triggers with his readers through Yu-kai Chou&#8217;s cognitive framework Octalysis. The framework identifies several factors with potential to drive engagement (called Core Drives) that can be applied across industries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what makes Gary\u2019s content so addictive?</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><b style=\"font-size: 1.14286rem; line-height: 1.84615;\">1. You can execute on his advice and see progress (Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The reason most people watch Gary is because\u00a0he\u00a0always provides concise, actionable, day to day tips or advice, that you can execute on your business. </span></p>\n<p>By providing value, rather than selling a dream, you can see that he is worth watching simply because it helps you grow, one step at a time. Gary is very upfront that there is no shortcut to success except hard work and talent, and his content helps you put that into practice.</p>\n<h3>2. He makes you feel part of the hustler\u2019s tribe (Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary is the leader of the \u2018hustler\u2019 community, these entrepreneurs with the mindset to make things happen, and who never give up. Seeing him hustle everyday makes you feel part of the tribe and gives you confidence that you can do it too, especially because of his casual, approachable look. </span></p>\n<p>Even if you didn\u2019t have the best day, Gary\u2019s motivation will pick you up. Because hustlers feel like non-hustlers will never be successful people, this pride to be part of the \u2018good side\u2019 of things reinforce the sense of belonging to the tribe. Remember though, just because you watch Gary\u2019s stuff doesn\u2019t make you a hustler\u2026</p>\n<h3>3. His genius makes you feel social-smart (Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp;\u00a0Relatedness)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary comes up with amazing punchlines (\u201cattention is the new currency\u201d, \u201cone is greater than zero\u201d) that people appropriate for themselves in social situation to appear and feel smart. I\u2019ve heard people using those in networking events and not quote the source, which always makes me laugh (how many people are \u2018so bullish on Snapchat\u2019 recently!)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Beyond the simple bragging factor though, people genuinely feel smarter because they understand the tagline and unconsciously appropriate Gary\u2019s genius for themselves.</span></p>\n<h3>4. His content is raw and unscripted (Core Drive: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether on the #AskGaryVee, Dailyvee or Snapchat, Gary\u2019s content is 100% genuine, non rehearsed, showing the good and the bad (late for meetings, bad news, even issues with sound recording). This makes the content unpredictable, which is a reason why you\u2019re hooked to it: what is going to happen next? What is Gary going to come up with today? You\u2019re not able to guess the plot and your curiosity takes over. To satisfy it, the only option is to watch his content!</span></p>\n<h3>5. You don&#8217;t want to miss out on the new tips (Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Gary\u2019s content is unpredictable, you do not know which episode will actually provide the most value. What if you skip one and Gary answers a question that could change your life? You do not want to take that risk, and the human aversion to risk kicks in: you keep up to date with his content to avoid the feeling of missing out. Snapchat and disappearing content emphasizes this effect the most, and Gary leverages this effect to get more followers on this platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Octalysis Framework characterizes this last core drive as Black Hat meaning that it is generally triggered by negative emotions &#8211; you watch to avoid a negative feeling, not to seek a positive one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is however a very powerful and widely used core drive that is easy to leverage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you identify the drive that motivates you to keep up with Gary\u2019s content the most?</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Samuel Huber is a young entrepreneur based in London. His company </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kout.io</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bridges the gap between games and e-commerce.

However, some of my favorite work still lies in my roots &#8211; the Startup World.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Startups are fun to work with because, almost by definition, they are doing things that have never been done before. They don\u2019t latch onto the status quo because they know the status quo is <strong>death</strong>, and they do everything possible to innovate and turn the needle from certain death to world-changing glory. Whereas large companies often make a handful of big experiments a year, startups often make company-altering experiments multiple times a week.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One such startup is <a href=\"http://www.dreamscloud.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DreamsCloud</a>. DreamsCloud is a pioneering startup in getting people to input and share their dreams every morning when they wake up. After people share their dreams, professional dream reflectors and dream enthusiasts alike can share their wisdom and insights on what the dreams mean. You may think this is an odd space to be in, but every month there are more than 90 million people online searching what their dreams mean. That&#8217;s almost a third of the US population searching for dream meanings on a monthly basis!</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Behavioral Challenge</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The challenge for the company is that, dreams must be recorded immediately after a person wakes up, because after a minute or two, the person will likely forget their dream. However, when most people wake up in the morning, recording their dreams is not likely the activity they are most concerned about. They are brushing their teeth, preparing for breakfast, and getting ready\u00a0for work/school. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I was brought in to help them improve the Desired Behavior of doing the activity loop of recording their dreams, as well as registering on the site, reading about other dreams, and creating a social community.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Octalysis Difference</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When I first started contributing, the company didn\u2019t have much traction. They were exploring pioneers in uncharted territories, and while having solid technology, it is tremendously difficult for most people to alter behavior. They were trying many ideas through different products, but none had caught on greatly.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6563\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6563\" style=\"width: 625px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Octalysis-Case-Study-2-1.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6563\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-6563 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Octalysis-Case-Study-2-1.png?resize=625%2C72&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Octalysis Case Study 2\" width=\"625\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Octalysis-Case-Study-2-1.png?resize=1024%2C118&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Octalysis-Case-Study-2-1.png?resize=300%2C34&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Octalysis-Case-Study-2-1.png?resize=768%2C88&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Octalysis-Case-Study-2-1.png?resize=624%2C72&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Octalysis-Case-Study-2-1.png?w=1644&amp;ssl=1 1644w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6563\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Monthly Traffic from Mid 2014 &#8211; Mid 2015. Stagnant at 6000-7000 Visitors at Mid 2015.</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">As you can see from the monthly traffic view, from mid 2014 to mid 2015 things were relatively stagnant. They had about 6,000-7,000 visitors a month, which is by all means not bad, but not enough to make them successful.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, after working with the team of incredibly smart and hard working people (as well as other experts and agencies), after 2015 they saw a massive breakthrough and grew tremendously into a dominating position. <strong>They went from mere thousands of unique visitors a month to over a million per month.</strong></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2017-11-25-at-10.01.24-AM.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6562\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-12279 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2017-11-25-at-10.01.24-AM.png?resize=660%2C171&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Octalysis Gamification Case Study\" width=\"660\" height=\"171\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2017-11-25-at-10.01.24-AM.png?resize=1024%2C266&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2017-11-25-at-10.01.24-AM.png?resize=300%2C78&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2017-11-25-at-10.01.24-AM.png?resize=768%2C200&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2017-11-25-at-10.01.24-AM.png?w=1427&amp;ssl=1 1427w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As you can see, by July 2016, they had around<strong> 2 Million</strong> visitors a month, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>increasing their traction metrics by 500X!</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And that\u2019s not all of it. <strong>Their conversion rates from visitor to registered user were in the double digits, and more impressively, 60% of newly registered users recorded a dream within 12 hours!\u00a0 </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I would again like to repeat that I in no way claim that I was the ONE who made all this happen, as it was a combination of great team effort. But I can say with certainty that I made a tangible difference in helping them get where they are today. </span><!--more--></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In this case study, I can share everything that is easily observed by the public, but I won\u2019t go into the details of many \u201csubtle\u201d or awesome future things they will be doing since it is important that DreamsCloud maintains that competitive edge. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Keep in mind that DreamsCloud is still in early MVP stage, and there are still many exciting (and more gameful things) they will be doing in the future. This is just step one, so if you see bugs or things you don\u2019t like, keep in mind it will get 100 times better in the future too.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Hocus Focus is the Magic Trick</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first advice I gave them was to focus on making ONE product extremely good, instead of pushing many products at the same time. Startups are passionate and ambitious, so they wanted to jump on every possible idea and opportunity. The company was pushing hard on their DreamsCloud.com portal, the DreamsCloud App, other iOS and Android apps called Dreamsphere (which is still an exciting vision on the horizon), and they were thinking about incorporating new technologies like wearables into their product offering (unfortunately I have to be vague here).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I often tell my clients: <b>\u201cIt is better to be awesome in a few places than it is to suck everywhere.</b>\u201d<b>\u00a0</b>Usually when a startup wants to do 5 things, they will find that for every one of those things, there are 5-10 companies that have ten times more money doing just that one thing. There is no way they can differentiate and win. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I recommended to focus on their core products first, so the engineering team does not need to run from one feature in one product to another feature in another product. After hammering on that nail a few times, they did a tremendous job focusing. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Applying the 8 Core Drives of Gamification</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The next step is to think about incorporating the 8 Core Drives of my Gamification Framework &#8220;Octalysis&#8221; into the Experience.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a quick refresher, the 8 Core Drives are what drives every single one of our behaviors in our lives. If none of the 8 Core Drives are there, there won\u2019t be any motivation, and no behavior happens. Let\u2019s see how DreamsCloud can incorporate these 8 Core Drives into their product through a<b>\u00a0</b>&#8220;Level I Octalyis\u00a0analysis&#8221;: </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The key about bringing Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling into the Dreamscloud experience is communicating that <b>Dreams Matter.</b>\u00a0Most people don\u2019t think dreams are significant enough and may even dismiss a whole company that is based on it.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, there are many examples of how understanding dreams greatly improved the lives of many people. Some of the best ideas in history, such as Google\u2019s Page Rank and Einstein\u2019s Relativity Theory was revealed in their dreams. Also, did you know a woman once learned that she was pregnant through her dreams, or a man was warned of his early stage cancer through his dream?\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our subconscious brain is extremely powerful and actually can process way more information and emotions than our conscious brain can comprehend. When clients ask me a question, and I answer, \u201cWell, there are three points to this,\u201d I don\u2019t first think through all those three points in my head before saying it. My subconscious brain already knew in an instant that there were three points and exactly what they were, my conscious brain had to slowly process them as I said them one at a time.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By letting users know that dreams can allow us to connect into our inner self, or come up with the next billion dollar idea, people can then be tied more into that Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling. Some even tie it into spirituality (there are many stories where God or spirits communicate through dreams etc.), but that may be alienating users who care about the science of dreams.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The key about any new technology is that it needs to make users feel smart. <strong>Note: this is not the same as users thinking that the product is smart. The users need to feel smart themselves.</strong> Google+ is an example where you have great engineers building a very advanced product, but when people reach the site, they feel stupid and leave quickly. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That is why it\u2019s important for DreamsCloud to guide users closer through a Step-By-Step Onboarding (Game Technique #6) process where they get acquainted with the activity loop before letting users go. Users also need to feel that everything they are doing is building towards something, whether it is dreams recorded, self understanding, or friends made.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, <b>you should never let users accidentally stumble upon a bad experience</b>. Everything the user can possibly do at the beginning should give them a good experience, so if you know in some scenarios the user would have an anti-climatical (not even bad, but uneventful) experience, remove the users ability to stumble upon that bad experience. Guide them to the First Major Win-State as soon as possible.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dream recording is a creative process. Sometimes people don\u2019t remember their dreams completely, or choose to record certain aspects of it. Also, some people prefer to do it in a light-hearted humorous way, while others like to talk about dreams in a solemn serious tone. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In this creative process, I advised DreamsCloud on allowing users to share their emotions easily and playfully in the product, so that every time they share it becomes a delightful experience that look forward to repeating. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, reflecting on other peoples\u2019 dreams is a fun and creative process too. It not only provides \u201cfeedback\u201d to the creativity of the dreamer, but by analyzing what others\u2019 dreams could mean, it becomes a fun detective game of obtaining clues and attempting to find the truth through questions like, \u201cHmm, have you been under stressful circumstances lately, especially related to women you admire?\u201d\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback is at the top right of the Octalysis Framework, it is a White Hat and Right Brain (symbolically representing the emotional brain) Intrinsic Core Drive. This means that it generates the longest lasting \u201cEvergreen Mechanics\u201d where users can come back and enjoy the experience for years to come. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Core Drive 4: Ownership &amp; Possession</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dreams are personal, and users feel a tremendous amount of ownership towards their own dreams. They want to understand their dreams, and they want to stash it away at a safe place where they can review later.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">DreamsCloud allows these precious dreams, which are often escaping your memory like falling stars, to be retained and kept. More importantly, it allows people to UNDERSTAND the value of what they already own.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We know in the Alfred Effect (Game Technique #83) that if a system constantly learns about you, you feel more attached to it and prefer to stay loyal even if another new technology was supposedly more advanced. The DreamsCloud engine is constantly learning about you through the dreams you record, and gives users intelligent \u201cMind Metrics\u201d to help them understand their inner selves.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, the system helps users keep track of their dreams better by tracking Dream Symbols and location so users can easily go back to old dreams from a year ago relating to a certain theme. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For most web platforms to succeed, it needs to be social. Unfortunately, dreams are quite personal and lots of people don\u2019t want their dreams to be known by other friends in their circles. DreamsCloud respects that privacy and allows users to post anonymously too, so they mostly focus on getting users on the platform to socialize with each other. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, through an interesting technology, it is still possible to share socially about DreamsCloud. DreamsCloud has a unique technology called Dreamscape, which is a computer generated image based on the dream people record. Usually the image is way too abstract to comprehend, but the benefit of that is it makes things less personal.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Users can share the Dreamscape on their social networks and ask their friends to guess what they dreamed of. Since no one will truly know the right answer, it is a safe and fun way to build conversation while promoting the DreamsCloud brand.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, there are other ways in the platform to build more collaboration and an ecosystem of gratitude, but I\u2019ll reserve that as future content to Octalysis Prime members, which is launching this year. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Core Drive 6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are many interesting Scarcity Design principles that can be implemented into DreamsCloud, which would undoubtedly make it an even more viral experience. However, we know that Core Drive 6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience is at the left bottom of the Octalysis Framework, which means it is Black Hat and Left Brain (symbolically representing our logical brain) Extrinsic Core Drive. This means that even though it could drive obsessive behavior, users won\u2019t necessarily feel good about it since they feel out of control.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The company is mostly focused on creating a great White Hat experience for their users, hence does not deploy many Core Drive 6 mechanisms besides the rare Professional Dream Reflections that you could earn by contributing to the platform.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, dreams are inherently scarce. You don\u2019t control how many dreams you will have, when you will have them, and if you don\u2019t record them quickly, they disappear. This creates a Time-Based Scarcity Trigger through Appointment Dynamics (Game Technique #21) which urgently reminds users to record their dreams the moment they wake up. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Core Drive 7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our brain craves unpredictable results. That\u2019s why the gambling and soap opera series thrive in a time when people are busier than ever before to spend time on\u00a0the \u201cimportant things in life.\u201d It is important for DreamsCloud to create an experience where every time users go onto the platform, they encounter an unexpected delightful experience through Easter Egg (Game Technique #30) and Mystery Box (Game Technique #72) designs. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When people go on the site, they want to see dreams that are fascinating and provokes curiosity. They want to see interesting comments and see what dream reflectors are saying. If they go on the site, but they don\u2019t see anything new or surprising, then the site has let the users accidentally stumbled upon a bad experience. Don&#8217;t ever let users accidentally stumble upon a bad experience.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To make company back multiple times a day a reoccuring habit, the user needs to constantly be checking back to see if anyone has analyzed their own dreams, or if there are new dreams that are amazingly fun and mind-blowing.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance is also a pure Black Hat Core Drive, and social community companies tend to not use it a lot. However, there are elements such as the FOMO Punch (Game Technique #84), which stands for \u201cFear-Of-Missing-Out Punch\u201d where the user becomes afraid of losing great insights from their dreams (remember every night your dreams could be telling you the next billion-dollar idea?), and so they feel compelled to jump on this opportunity to not miss out the greatness (or significance when it comes to being pregnant or having cancer) that is to be. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, there is a Sunk Cost Prison (Game Technique #50) system, where if a user has been recording all their dreams on the site over a few years, they are unlikely to quit and switch to other platforms because all this dream data, analytics, understanding, social connection are all there on the platform. Of course, they can copy and paste all their posts elsewhere, and Dreamscloud certainly wouldn\u2019t mind people exporting their own dream data (given enough engineering resources to push that out), but it just becomes a hassle in the brain (and Cognitive Dissonance) where people are not likely to switch due to Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>DreamsCloud: A Great Investment</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Again, there are WAY more details and subtle components that made DreamsCloud more successful by the day, but the above is a high level overview of how they gradually improved and an example of how you can utilize Octalysis to improve your own products. To learn more about how to use Octalysis and Behavioral Design to transform your life and products, you could either sign up to my quarterly workshops or wait for the long-anticipated Octalysis Prime that is launching in 2016 (or just keep reading this blog through the mailing list). </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, <b>with this new-found success, DreamsCloud is currently raising a pre-Series A Round of $2.5 Million to grow their success fifty-times over</b>. Since they already know what to do to create a compelling experience and drive behavior, now they just need the fire power to execute on all the things they already know they should do. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Not surprisingly, as of now they have already raised $800,000 of their $2.5 Million round. Another client of mine in Australia took the MVP we designed for them and showed it to investors, and they instantly raised close to $1.5 Million within 2 weeks.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m also giving the disclaimer (but it\u2019s more of an endorsement) that I saw so much potential in DreamsCloud\u2019s success, \u00a0that I later agreed to take my fees in the form equity, so I am a very minor shareholder. LOTS of startup companies pitch me their equity, and I almost always say no since it is messy and most of it will become zero, but for a selected few companies such as DreamsCloud, I excitedly agreed.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I hope this case study piece was helpful to you in many ways.

Email yukai[at]yukaichou[dot]com if you have would like to guest post about gamification/Octalysis/Behavioral Design)</em></p>\n<p>For the past three years I\u2019ve been immersed in a global gaming subculture that thrives around the augmented reality game, Ingress. Then I read Yukai\u2019s book and was immediately struck by the Core Drives and how applicable they are to problem-solving in general. \u00a0As a User Experience professional, I\u2019ve taken a lot from what I have learned playing the game. My clients and colleagues are always surprised when I say that. They see games as merely entertainment. (One in particular can\u2019t finish a sentence without saying \u201c<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=roll+tide\" target=\"_blank\">Roll Tide</a>,\u201d yet he isn\u2019t connecting how deeply games can impact people. Seriously.)</p>\n<p>What I know, and what many Ingress players know, is that while games can indeed serve as nothing but escapism or entertainment,<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they also have the potential to be a shortcut to personal and professional growth</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They inspire, motivate, teach and yes, turn into obsessions. I\u2019d like to share with you what I\u2019ve learned about that through the game Ingress in Octalysis parlance. </span><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-1-epic-meaning-calling/#.VszwVZMrJMY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can read more about Octalysis here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Then I\u2019d like to explain how I\u2019m using what I\u2019ve learned in my own business. To do that, let me set the scene. You need to understand how Ingress works to understand how the Core Drives apply.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ss-Z-QjFUio?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>You can download an app on your Android or iOS phone that lets you track places in the world that have XM, or exotic matter, bubbling through them.

A new person who stumbles across these portals might be led to search for more information about XM and will find videos made by investigators.</p>\n<p>The XM investigators have discovered that there are Others, called Shapers, that seem to be influencing humans through the XM. You will see debates about whether or not XM affects us and whether it was the XM that caused the humans to create or achieve, or if the humans did it on their own. You\u2019ll see that there are two factions.</p>\n<p>There are those who embrace the Shapers (the Enlightened) and those who would rather not have their minds affected, thank you very much (the Resistance). When you download your XM scanner, you must choose a side. Then you have the ability to capture portals and make them resonate with the color of your faction, green or blue.</p>\n<p>Green Enlightened resonators allow the Shaper influence to flow unhindered. Blue Resistance resonators create a blocking and protective resonance for that portal.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6600\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6600\" style=\"width: 190px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scanner_20150203_210544_1.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6600\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-6600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scanner_20150203_210544_1.png?resize=190%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Portal\" width=\"190\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scanner_20150203_210544_1.png?resize=190%2C300&amp;ssl=1 190w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scanner_20150203_210544_1.png?resize=768%2C1210&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scanner_20150203_210544_1.png?resize=650%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 650w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scanner_20150203_210544_1.png?resize=624%2C983&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scanner_20150203_210544_1.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Ingress scanner, this is a blue Resistance portal with a ring around it.

You get resonators and bursters by hacking the portal through the scanner.</p>\n<p>Bursters allow you to knock all the opposing resonators off the portal and claim it for your faction. Players meet together in person regularly and must cooperate in order to achieve. The side with the most mind influence (measured in mind units or MU) is winning.</p>\n<p>The game runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, globally. It never stops. There have been over 10 million downloads. In my city we usually have around 600 players active in a given week.</p>\n<p>In the officially organized events and global operations, I have known players to literally climb mountains, rent boats and helicopters. They fly airplanes and travel hundreds of miles through deserts or ice to reach a portal.</p>\n<p>One group rented a helicopter and flew over a volcano. Timing can be critical and the strategies employed can be ruthless. This game can challenge all you have mentally, physically and socially. I\u2019ve seen thousands of people on the streets of a city and known players who travel around the USA, Europe, China, Japan, Australia, parts of Africa, India and Asia for these events.</p>\n<p>One operation covered the North Pole. Players have to travel within reach of the portals needed to succeed (40 meters). There are portals in Antarctica. Someone had to go there to get those built and get portal keys. Team cooperation is global.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6601\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6601\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bowtie.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6601\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-6601\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bowtie.png?resize=300%2C154&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"deadliestBAF\" width=\"300\" height=\"154\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bowtie.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bowtie.png?resize=768%2C395&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bowtie.png?resize=1024%2C527&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bowtie.png?resize=624%2C321&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bowtie.png?w=1637&amp;ssl=1 1637w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6601\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One large scale North American Resistance Operation that involved coordinating thousands of agents in real time.</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6604\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6604\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2014-07-26.jpg?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6604\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-6604 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2014-07-26.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Alaskan portion of the operation\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2014-07-26.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2014-07-26.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2014-07-26.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Picture taken by @unclebeldin as he was on the operation above, in Alaska</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6605\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6605\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-6605 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2014-07-26-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Resistance players in Baja\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2014-07-26-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2014-07-26-1.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2014-07-26-1.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6605\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From the same operation, players in Baja/Cabo area</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Are you understanding yet how motivated Ingress players are?

It\u2019s about understanding why people care and behave the way they do and building components into your systems that are fueled by these core drives to help you achieve your goals. I liken that to alchemy. It\u2019s the understanding and application of these motivations that makes the magic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing Ingress is an excellent opportunity to learn more about these core drives so you can practice them. People who don\u2019t play video games play Ingress. We told the creators of Ingress that they had made a sport with a cell phone. That\u2019s true. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What things have I learned from Ingress? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned more about who I was by being forced to participate in the context of a larger community. I learned a lot by working with teams in other cultures. Zagreb, Croatia and Perth Australia are very different. In this day and age, freelancing can be lonely and churches can be distant. Having a community locally and globally to plug into and swim in taught me much about myself, both about my own strengths and my weaknesses. </span></p>\n<p>I learned more about people by watching them play than I ever could through conversation. In game play there is honesty. You can\u2019t deceive others about who you are, your actions speak. The applications for this to the business world were immense. I\u2019ve learned to watch what people do. I&#8217;ve learned to be a lot more wise in my dealings with others.</p>\n<p>The game taught me how to win and how to lose. It taught me to keep going in the face of adversity, it taught me how to listen and the value of hearing. It taught me how not to work with others. It taught me the value of trust and of truth. I had to learn to implement motivational techniques to achieve team objectives. I had to learn how to admit I was wrong and how to make amends. I have never examined motivations more, either those of myself or my colleagues.</p>\n<p>Ingress gave me an understanding of how powerful these Core Drives are and how key they are in solving problems, not only the problems that exist in a game world, but the problems that exist in my real world. I got to practice planning and learn from my mistakes in an arena where what was at stake wasn\u2019t my livelihood.</p>\n<p>I learned how to work and communicate better with my husband because of Ingress. Before we started to play Ingress together my husband had joined me in my business full time. Going from working solo to being with your spouse 24/7 isn\u2019t a simple feat. Ingress gave us an outlet, a shared community and other goals besides work goals on which to practice working together. It definitely strengthened our relationship.</p>\n<p>Most of all, Ingress gave me confidence to move forward in my professional life. After successfully working with teams in over 85 countries and achieving billions of MU for the Resistance, I realize that the only thing stopping me in my business and real life, is me. I\u2019m not afraid now to hire, to grow. \u00a0I know I have the tools and skills I need to move forward in my next steps, I just have to keep moving forward.</p>\n<p>I was invited to Google in March of 2015 to meet the engineers and leaders of Niantic Labs, who were then still at Google Venice. I ended up talking to the Community Manager for 5 hours. One of the things we discussed was the use cases for Ingress, real world applications for the game engine. He said that he could see churches and businesses being able to use it for team building or growth, and I understood why immediately. It\u2019s a powerful vehicle.</p>\n<h2>How am I putting what I have learned into practice?</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6640\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6640\" style=\"width: 1002px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.redtoadmedia.com/gamificator.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6640\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-6640 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gamificator.png?resize=1002%2C722&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"gamificator\" width=\"1002\" height=\"722\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gamificator.png?w=1002&amp;ssl=1 1002w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gamificator.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gamificator.png?resize=768%2C553&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gamificator.png?resize=624%2C450&amp;ssl=1 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6640\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of the simple tools we have built to help businesses, more are coming.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are no longer immersed in Ingress.

It\u2019s exciting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also understand how important it is for our own company to adhere to an <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-1-epic-meaning-calling/#.VtB_QZMrJQY\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Meaning and Calling.</a>\u00a0We are practicing new ways to apply the Core Drives in our own business processes. We hope to be able to combat burnout, discouragement and failure, not only for ourselves, but for those we work with. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goal is Transformation</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At its core, gamification, or gameful design, is the opportunity to transform something ordinary into something special. That is what Octalysis, understanding and applying\u00a0its principles, offers you. You might never be interested in playing a game like Ingress, but if you understand the impact of applying all the core drives, you can change your corner of the world. Become an agent of change.

They are a tool that easily allows any website to implement game design elements to motivate behavior. If you notice, the little widget on the right side of my side is from Captain Up.)</em></p>\n<p>Behavioral economics is a fascinating scientific field. It revolves around the way in which we make decisions and what drives us to do what we do. This is a new bonanza for prominent online brands \u2013 a better understanding of their followers and clients, more accurate compliance to their needs. There is no doubt that viewing user engagement as a revenue enhancer is an innovative concept for online brands and a noteworthy trend.</p>\n<p>What was once only part of hugely popular social games like \u201cCandy Crush\u201d and \u201cClash of Clans\u201d is now driving new and exciting engagement features for leading online brands.</p>\n<h3><strong>Turning motivations into actions</strong></h3>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that user acquisition and online marketing are an endless challenge, and that\u2019s even before we get started on user loyalty. It is a Sisyphic struggle, constantly seeking to get new clients on board while also preserving the existing ones. However, the modern online marketer\u2019s arsenal hasn\u2019t really evolved over the past couple of years. User acquisition tools have mainly focused on more-of-the-same marketing methodologies generating more-of-the-same results. But there\u2019s a wind of change blowing.</p>\n<h3><strong>\u201cTotal immersion\u201d \u2013 the essence of successful brands</strong></h3>\n<p>In this day and age, maintaining a great brand is much more than advertising or marketing. It is not all about the quality of your product or service but about the adrenaline rush created by a flawless and exciting user experience, driving users in and getting them to come back for more.</p>\n<p>This user experience is driven by what is called \u201ctotal immersion\u201d. The whole brand scenery surrounds the user, creating a unique atmosphere and a special vibe people get hooked on.</p>\n<p>But what creates this atmosphere? Well\u2026 everything. From the big picture to the smallest details, every aspect of the user\u2019s journey is pre-calculated and designed to support their decision making process.</p>\n<h3><strong>Spot the right motivations and</strong> <strong>p</strong><strong>rovide solutions </strong></h3>\n<p>The basic assumptions for boosting user involvement and loyalty through engagement are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People are looking for a sense of belonging \u2013 belonging to a community is a valid and powerful incentive to act upon. (Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness in the Octalysis Framework)</li>\n<li>The right reward for the right action \u2013 customizing and offering the right rewards for preferred actions drives excellent engagement from users.</li>\n<li>Good design has super-powers \u2013 getting a message through to users and driving them to action is a form of art combined with psychology. Great and carefully planned design can do magic to online user engagement.</li>\n<li>People want to be engaged \u2013 they are just looking for a good enough reason to engage with your particular experience.</li>\n<li>Content is king \u2013 it won\u2019t do you any good trying to motivate and incentivize your users if your basic offering \u2013 your content, service, or product \u2013 isn\u2019t good enough. Offer great content and start from there.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Captain Up &#8211; The new generation of user engagement solutions for super brands </strong></h3>\n<p>Today\u2019s brands realize that in order to attain a new level of brand loyalty and engagement with their fans they have to act differently and enhance the user experience dramatically. To do so, the startup <a href=\"http://www.captainup.com\" target=\"_blank\">Captain Up</a> has developed a platform that aims directly to the heart of these needs.</p>\n<p>Captain Up has developed a SaaS platform to provide a new generation of retention and loyalty, based on insights from behavioral economics.

Some were more penalizing than others, and some may have cost me my company or set back years of my efforts.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, because I also did a few things correctly, I ended up okay. But these mistakes are valuable lessons for me today, and likely for new entrepreneurs who want to maneuver the crazy startup/life jungle.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, as I look through the list below, I realized one of the common themes in the mistakes below relate to caring too much about what other people think but not following what made sense to me. Good advice is golden, but following bad advice or mere pure pressure may be detrimental for an entrepreneur.</p>\n<p><strong>Here is list my top 10 mistakes in life as an entrepreneur.</strong></p>\n<h3>10) Listen to MBA students from Anderson School to write a\u00a060 page business plan</h3>\n<p>When I started my first technology startup as an undergrad at UCLA, I looked towards some students at the Anderson business school for some mentorship. To an undergrad student interested in business, MBA students were like masters of the universe, and we believed in everything they said. They advised that I create a very robust business plan that factored in all the MBA training they were receiving.</p>\n<p>This whole process took more than 4 months of valuable startup execution time, especially when our plans keep changing. When the business plan was already 55 pages long, one of the MBA students said, &#8220;you still missed a section on listing out and describing the 5 Risk.&#8221; That was another one week.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, once I finally proudly displayed my 60 page bullet proof business plan to a Venture Capitalist, she annoying told me, &#8220;Oh we don&#8217;t look at anything beyond a presentation deck or a 1-page executive summary.&#8221; That crushed me.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> just because someone is successful in their own rights doesn&#8217;t mean they are the expert at what you are doing. MBA students are generally smart individuals who worked mostly entry-level at big corporations like Consulting or Investment Banking Firms. Their achievements of being there is highly respectable, but often they don&#8217;t know a lot about how the startup world works.</p>\n<p>Your divorce lawyer uncle is not a corporate lawyer. Don&#8217;t mistaken success to true relevant expertise.</p>\n<h3>9) Spent too much time making my first business &#8220;look legit&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Similar to the mistake above, when I started my very first business (not tech startup) first year in college, I was enthralled with the idea of having my own business.</p>\n<p>I spent a lot of time figuring out legal options, website stuff, logos and business cards &#8211; basically the things that made me look like a &#8220;legitimate business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I did that for a couple months, and I felt great about it. However, I later realized I didn&#8217;t spend any time making my business actually more valuable. My ego probably got in the way (you know, like giving people a business card with a fancy logo that says you are CEO of your company), but since my business didn&#8217;t have true value or content, eventually all that was trashed as I moved on to other ideas, logos, websites and concepts.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> many of the most successful companies came about as hobby projects that didn&#8217;t have any business structure before they got traction. Instead of making your business &#8220;look&#8221; legit, it is much better to focus on your product or talking to customers to ensure that they would actually buy your service once it is ready.</p>\n<h3>8) Trying too hard to fit into my business fraternity</h3>\n<p><!--more-->In my second year of college, I was already a budding entrepreneur, and I was attracted by the Business Fraternity Delta Sigma Pi on my campus because I wanted to build relationships with other student entrepreneurs on campus.</p>\n<p>I initially thought that everyone there would be running businesses\u00a0too like I was, so I could learn from their advice and experiences. However, the group was mostly inspired and very intelligent college students who wanted to get into big corporate jobs like Investment Banking, Management Consulting, and Accounting.</p>\n<p>I was the weird one out in the group, and for a long time I tried REALLY hard to fit in. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, joining Delta Sigma Pi was one of the best things I did in my life. The pledging for Delta Sigma Pi was difficult but superb training (I still muse about how good that training was a decade later), and I have met some of my closest friends in my life, including my past Co-founder Jun Loayza, through DSP.</p>\n<p>However, my mistake was that, in the years after I joined, I worked too hard to do things that tried to fit in. I showed up at every single gathering and event, ready to help and create value. I worked to\u00a0become an expert at case interviews for management consulting and even coached a few people into those careers. But ultimately, I was very bad at fitting in, and it seriously distracting to what I really wanted to do, which was to\u00a0start new companies.</p>\n<p>After a year or two of trying really hard to become more like those around me, one member of the fraternity mentioned in the group, &#8220;The one thing I really respect about Yu-kai is that he doesn&#8217;t give a crap about how others see him.&#8221; Clearly I failed miserably at becoming more like them.</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> sometimes when you feel like you don&#8217;t fit into a group, you feel compelled to alter your own plans to become better accepted. That often doesn&#8217;t work very well. Rather, it may be better to focus what you are passionate about, be the person you would respect yourself, and confidently live your life for who you are. Often, you will be respected and gain followers because of that.</p>\n<p>A while later, I went back to pursue my own startups. Perhaps because I was doing things within my own element (or simply because I had more seniority within the organization), I felt I was more accepted and respected in the organization. That was also when Jun Loayza, who was always the &#8220;cool kid&#8221; I wanted to be like, came to me and said, &#8220;Hey, what you&#8217;re doing is really interesting. Can I join?&#8221;</p>\n<h3>7) Not understand black hat motivation when raising funding</h3>\n<p>When I was running my startups, I spent a good amount of time raising funding. It appears that investors liked me, respected me as an entrepreneur, and was impressed by my business. However, they kept telling me to come back with more before they would fund me.</p>\n<p>At the time, I still have yet to develop my <a href=\"http://www.octalysis.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">behavioral design framework Octalysis</a> and I didn&#8217;t know the difference between <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/white-hat-black-hat-gamification-octalysis-framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">White Hat vs Black Hat Motivation</a>.</p>\n<p>In summary: <strong>White Hat Motivation makes people feel powerful, good, and in control, but there is no sense of urgency. Black Hat Motivation makes people feel urgent, obsessed, even addicted, but it may leave a bad taste in their mouths because they don&#8217;t feel like they are in control of their own actions.</strong></p>\n<p>Since I didn&#8217;t understand these principles, I focused on White Hat Motivation, telling investors how smart it would be to invest in my business and how big of an impact the business would do in this world. However, the nature of White Hat is that there is no urgency. They liked the business, but as long as they felt the opportunity would still be there a week later, they felt no urgency to invest immediately. This went on for a VERY long time and also cost the business greatly.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> instead of just focusing on &#8220;being nice&#8221; and presenting a good investment opportunity, it&#8217;s important to\u00a0add some black hat motivation during fundraising. I had to add more scarcity, exclusivity, and fear of missing out in my presentations, even if it made the investors feel slightly uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, for one of my startups, when I finally raised $650k, I wrote to potential investors that were &#8220;waiting to see more&#8221; that we were closing the round. Surprisingly, many of the investors that seemed rather indifferent for an entire year suddenly seemed offended and pushed for us taking their investment. It was like we were burning bridges if we didn&#8217;t take their money. At the end, I was only looking for $600,000, but ended up taking $1,050,000 while still rejecting some money. It&#8217;s important to have both White Hat and Black Hat in any type of transaction.</p>\n<h3>6) Not letting go of people face to face</h3>\n<p>Being a leader sometimes means you have to make the hard decisions while stomaching the consequences.</p>\n<p>One of most difficult, or emotional draining, responsibilities\u00a0in my career is firing people. I have hired lots of people before, but I have also had to fire over a dozen of them, many of them being my friends. I once had to fire a guy I went to college with, whom I relocated from LA to Silicon Valley. I have only been living with him in the same apartment for a few months, where I realized even though he was a great guy and a cultural fit, his skill set wasn&#8217;t what the business needed for its challenges.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the mistake I make is not that I let people go, but how I did it. In this one case (which is a life long regret), I was out of town and couldn&#8217;t come back in time. His team wrote to me asking me when will I do it because it was awkward that everyone else in the office knew besides him (so they wouldn&#8217;t give him more things to work on).</p>\n<p>In that urgency (also Black Hat), I wrote a very long email informing him that he has been let go. There was a long side story of exactly what happened that day, but ultimately I saw later it was the wrong thing to do. I should have waited to come back first and do it face to face, show my concern and appreciation, and give him an opportunity to ask questions.</p>\n<p>Since I was still living with him at the time, I was a bit scared to go back home at night since meeting him would be a quite\u00a0awkward. He of course quickly moved out and relocated back to Southern California.</p>\n<p>Years later I wrote another very long apology letter to him, telling him I was immature and made a big mistake, but he never responded. It still hurts me to this day.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> quite simply, if you are to tell people of any decision that would negatively impact their lives, it would be better to tell them in person. Another small example was when one of my companies failed due to an unexpected event, I called our four interns that were driving from Berkeley and told them to turn around and go back, simply because I didn&#8217;t want them to drive an hour to the office, just to learn that they should go home. They all sounded so sad and confused on the phone.</p>\n<p>Looking back, I should have had them come, giving them proper closure on why we had to shut down face-to-face and also allow them to ask questions. Telling them to turn back made logical and efficiency sense but was not emotionally appropriate for the occasion.</p>\n<h3>5) Hanging on to &#8220;promising hope&#8221; while risking personal well being</h3>\n<p>When that same startup\u00a0above\u00a0failed, we should have shut down our servers and ceased all operations. However, when we informed this news to an investor that is a public company, they told us not to and said, &#8220;Hey, we now decided that your space is a huge focus for our company. We could start our own devision, but we thought it would be better if we just invested another $1 Million into your business. If it takes off, we can then acquire you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From my own experience, I know most deals that sound great end up falling through, so I was skeptical. I also wanted the company to show that they will support us fully with their resources. In response to my skepticism, the CEO and the VP of the company were meeting me once to twice a week, and I thought, &#8220;Wow, that is very sincere of them!&#8221; How often do you meet a CEO of a public company more than once a week? So instead of shutting down our servers and other overhead costs (when we had no money), we kept it running in hopes we can revive the company.</p>\n<p>After 2-3 months of back and forths, everything seemed ready to go. They just needed one last board meeting for the board to approve and then we were a go. We were optimistic and excited &#8211; we really needed the funding. Unfortunately, after a few days of not replying to our emails, they responded, &#8220;Sorry, there was one board member that really didn&#8217;t like the idea, so it&#8217;s probably not going to happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Generally, this is fine, but because we kept our operational costs going, we got into debt that couldn&#8217;t be paid for when the investment deal fell through. Most people at that point have moved on to other opportunities, but as CEO of the company I ended up trying to make income elsewhere I paid $18,000 out of my own pocket to cover the debt that wouldn&#8217;t have been there if we just ceased operations. (Note: one of my Co-Founders came back to me two years later and wrote me a $1500 check, saying that he felt bad not taking responsibilities along with me because it was emotionally too much at the time, but now he wanted to make up a little bit for it. I REALLY appreciated it.)</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Most deals fall through. Honestly. It doesn&#8217;t matter how good it looks nor how promising/sincere the other side seems to be. Chances are, the awesome deal would not happen. This isn&#8217;t to say that you should stop pursuing these great deals, but you should not put all your eggs in that basket to the point where you are devastated if it doesn&#8217;t go through.</p>\n<p>Since 9 out of 10 amazing deals fall through, you need to make sure you can afford to pursue 10 of these instead of committing to one company savior. The nice thing is, as long as one of the deals really came true (or was at least half as good as how they pitched it), it would take your company to a whole new level and thrive. You just need to be able to withstand the setback\u00a0if this one didn&#8217;t come true (oh yes, and ALL deals take much longer than you expect).</p>\n<h2>4) Focusing too much on customers, not investors (!!)</h2>\n<p>This is an odd lesson for me, because I still don&#8217;t like to believe this is a true principle to live by. When I was running that same startup from above, we determined that we\u00a0shouldn&#8217;t focus our resources on &#8220;being cool&#8221; in Silicon Valley and impressing other entrepreneurs and investors. Those seem to be ego metrics that made us feel good. Rather, we should focus our resources on our customers.</p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t spend money creating presence at Tech Crunch and other startup conferences, nor tried to get press on startup media outlets. Rather, we sponsored conferences where our customers were at, such as the Multi-Unit Franchising Conference in Las Vegas and getting press in magazines our customers read. We figured, if customers loved us, investors would be logical to give us money later on.</p>\n<p>Our strategy &#8220;looked&#8221; successful. We were really well known in our customer space, and many large franchise executives held meetings with us for national deployments. Our product was performing 11x better than our closet competitors, at least based on the press release they bragged about. We thought we were unstoppable.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to raise funding, as mentioned above, investors were impressed with our success but they lacked the emotional urge to invest. They carefully and logically invested in our track record and said they liked it a lot but would like to see more. Yes, this seems very natural for an investor, since investing should be a very logical trade. However, we had competitors that had less numbers but literally raised ten times more than we raised (so they did not need to worry about raising money before reaching new heights).</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong>\u00a0Besides taking up personal responsibility and saying I didn&#8217;t do the best job raising money, I believe it&#8217;s because the competitors were much more well known in the startup world and Silicon Valley. One of them came out of a famous incubator, and the other was closely related to another startup that also did something well-known. We realized that investors loved to invest into startups that they and their friends already knew about, so they could brag to their friends, &#8220;You know that company you keep seeing on Tech Crunch? I got in on that deal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bragging rights!\u00a0I learned later that instead of rationally looking at the numbers of a business, many investors decide to take that final jump for emotional reasons (which is actually true for all human beings). We may have looked good on paper, but the &#8220;Silicon Valley brand names&#8221; were emotionally more attractive. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>IF</strong></span> your startup relies on investor money to stay alive, THEY are your true customers. Your business customers are actually just a means to an end to raise more funding. As much as I hate this lesson, I will never forget it.</p>\n<h3>3) Trying to do something too far into the future</h3>\n<p>This is also an odd lesson for me, but apparently it would be &#8220;don&#8217;t be TOO visionary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After being an entrepreneur for a decade (with varying levels of success and way more failures), I realized that a big problem I had was that almost all my ideas were considered \u201ctoo early.\u201d Ever since my first business in college, I would talk to VCs (notice this theme of depending on VCs? Bad.) and they would tell me what I was doing was ridiculous and wouldn\u2019t work. I then decide to give that up and pivot to something else (after all, of course these grownups were smarter than I was). 3-5 years later, all the VCs were suddenly fighting to fund other companies with that very model I did earlier, but unfortunately I had moved on.</p>\n<p>When I approached them again with my new companies, they would say, \u201cYu-kai, your last business was actually right on! But your new thing here\u2026.that\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d And of course, the same thing would happen again. Now keep in mind\u00a0celebrity entrepreneurs who has had big exits in the past could raise a lot of money for crazy and audacious ideas. They then had the funding to truck through a few years until the market caught up. At the timing I wasn&#8217;t that celebrity entrepreneur, so I shouldn\u2019t play by those same rules.</p>\n<p>This is important for all those new aspiring entrepreneurs that often read how companies raise tens of millions of dollars before launching a product on Tech Crunch. In general, if you can\u2019t raise money just on your past exit records, you generally need <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>traction</strong></span>\u00a0before you can raise significant money. Now how to get traction without the money you are raising is the difficult work of a resourceful entrepreneur.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Upon recognizing my tendency and problem, I realized I could adapt and adjust to that\u2026no more crazy startups. Focus on what the world needs, not what it deserves (thanks Batman for bitter-sounding concepts\u00a0haha). Sometimes your idea is brilliant and could really change the world (and every once in a while a lottery winner really does it), but if the world isn&#8217;t ready for it (investors or customers) and you don&#8217;t have the resources to stay alive until it does, you are only doing marketing work for new startups that will come out after your death.</p>\n<p>LUCKILY, all my startup ideas and concepts surrounded this theme called Gamification (or Serious Games, or Gameful Design, Loyalty Programs etc.), so when gamification really became an industry that people KNEW they cared about, I was one of the very few people who have been doing it for close to a decade. I became a known pioneer in an industry that I had no idea was one. I wish that was a lesson regarding following your passion, but honestly I was just lucky that the world started to care about what I was passionate for a few years after.</p>\n<h3>2) Believing in a law firm even when it made no sense (a long one&#8230;)</h3>\n<p><em>(This one turned out to be an extremely long one. I was thinking about taking out the\u00a0details here, but I ended up deciding that it&#8217;s specific experiences like these that can teach fellow entrepreneurs the most. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">You can skip straight to the Lesson Learned at the end if you want. It might actually make you laugh if you do it.</span>)</em></p>\n<p>When I was creating my earlier startups, I registered for an LLC. Then I learned that for a VC to invest in a business, I needed to be a C-Corp. At the time, a well known law firm in Silicon Valley (let&#8217;s just call it GD) reached out and offered their &#8220;startup friendly&#8221; program, which basically means they will do free work, mostly incorporation and fundraising, for us until we raised funding. These type of programs are quite popular in Silicon Valley and for any cash-strapped entrepreneur, it is a very attractive deal. We decided to bring them on to help us convert our LLC to a C-Corp.</p>\n<p>The issue came when they appointed a very junior lawyer to work on our company, since we were&#8217;t a revenue generator and it&#8217;s a good opportunity for entry-level practice. They told us that it&#8217;s pretty complicated work to convert an LLC to a C-Corp and it would be &#8220;easier&#8221; to create a C-Corp from scratch and then transfer all the ownership and assets from the LLC to the new company. I was in my early 20&#8217;s and didn&#8217;t know any better, so I agreed with every proposal they gave.</p>\n<p>Then afterwards, they said they created the new company, gave me an Articles of Incorporation from Delaware, and informed me that\u00a0I should start doing transactions with the new C-Corp. They said, however, to do some final steps, they needed to charge regular legal fees. That came as a surprise to me, so I responded, &#8220;I totally understand you guys need to charge a fee for your services. But right now we&#8217;re really tight and I was wondering if we would be okay if we did this later when we get better funded?&#8221; They said yes.</p>\n<h3>The Bastard Bank Account</h3>\n<p>Since in my mind, I only had one company (I never wanted two) and all the business operations remained the same, I asked, &#8220;Yes I&#8217;ll do all transactions with the new company. But it&#8217;s a lot of work to setup a new bank account and transfer the money etc. Could I use the old bank account for now until I had time to make the transfer?&#8221;</p>\n<p>This I still have email records of, but the junior lawyer replied &#8220;Yes.&#8221; This felt a little bit weird to me, because it felt weird to have two company structures using the same bank account, but again, I was just a kid who loved to innovate. What did I know about legal operations and business structures compared to actual prestigious lawyers? So I took his word and started doing all my paperwork with the C-Corp but sent and received money with the LLC.</p>\n<p>This became a COMPLETE disaster that kept coming back to bite me over a 5 year period. First of all, accounting was a nightmare every year. I had no idea what I was supposed to do with the C-Corp tax return vs the LLC tax return. Since we couldn&#8217;t afford real accountants, I just tried to get Turbo Tax Business and file for the &#8220;relatively simple taxes&#8221; ourselves (since we didn&#8217;t have much revenue or expenses as a new startup&#8230;). Oh, since\u00a0the LLC wasn&#8217;t completely closed, we had to pay $800/mo franchising fee for that, so for a while we were double paying.</p>\n<h3>The Legal Brokenness</h3>\n<p>There were also a lot of issues too relating to things we had to file for our business that we didn&#8217;t know about.</p>\n<p>When we were hiring people, payroll services asked for my company EIN. Huh? What&#8217;s that? Oh, this number that every company should have, just like a Society Security Number. I guess GD forgot to tell us we needed to get this after they formed our business. That delayed us by a few weeks when we wanted to bring people on board immediately (which is hugely costly for a startup since at any given moment we only have months to live).</p>\n<p>Then when we wanted to submit something to the app store, they asked for our California Number. Hmm, we only have a Delaware Incorporation number. Oh, we were a &#8220;Delaware Corporation operating in California&#8221; and need a CA number. I guess GD didn&#8217;t inform us of that either. That took another few weeks to get through governmental bureaucracy and delayed our product lunch by that much time &#8211; which again was costly.</p>\n<p>When I finally brought in another boutique law firm a couple years later to look at what is going on and help clean up our stuff, they asked for a few more documents. I said, &#8220;We only have an Articles of Incorporation.&#8221; The Partner at that law firm then told me, &#8220;Did you know your two-year old corporation has no board, no board members, and no shareholders?&#8221; I replied (paraphrasing), &#8220;Oops. That&#8217;s not good. I don&#8217;t think our investors or cofounders would like that.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m amazed how a big law firm like GD didn&#8217;t set these basic things up for you!&#8221;</p>\n<p>In all honesty, I didn&#8217;t mind them not doing the work since I wasn&#8217;t paying, but I felt they should at least tell me what they didn&#8217;t do and what I had to do myself. I felt completely confident that I was working with a huge startup-focused law firm, and so I just believed that they setup everything well and I didn&#8217;t have to worry about it.</p>\n<h3>The IRS Audit</h3>\n<p>A few years after being completely frustrated with this &#8220;two-company setup,&#8221; I finally completely resolved it and\u00a0shut off the old LLC. I thought my nightmares were finally over, until I was raising funding for my new venture, close towards the end of our runway (or the funding we had). At that time I suddenly got a request from the IRS to do an audit on my former LLC.</p>\n<p>The IRS noticed that, the money going in our &#8220;LLC Bank Account&#8221; was different from the taxes we reported for the LLC. A big chunk of that was because, in order to stay alive, we did some web development contracting work. We got business from clients, took a middle fee, and paid a contractor to do most of the work. However, the clients revenue went into the LLC&#8217;s bank account. Even though we paid the contractor from the same bank account, as instructed we gave him a 1099 (proof of paying him for the IRS) through the new C-Corp as instructed.</p>\n<p>This meant that, even though in our own books we only made a very small profit from the transaction, to the IRS our LLC business took in a whole lot of revenue and was highly profitable, while our C-Corp business paid an expensive contract and was hugely in the loss. Being very concerned, I finally hired an accounting firm to help me handle this, even though we were already low on funding.</p>\n<p>The accountants looked at the case, and said, &#8220;Well, based on the records and the mix-up of the bank accounts, the best case scenario is that you pay a penalty fee to the IRS. The worse case scenario is that you are seen as committing fraud and could see jail time.&#8221; That caused me to panic. Even if I didn&#8217;t end up going to jail, just news of the investigation would cause any pending investor to back off and would kill my company, now with over a dozen employees in it.</p>\n<p>Not only did I pay the accountants quite a bit to retroactively go through the books of two companies for a few years (costly in itself), I spent almost full time gathering information, getting old statements of a company I already closed from the bank, and discussing how should we explain this to the IRS.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget I was still trying to raise money for a startup that is near it&#8217;s runway! Needless to say, it was extremely emotionally draining and distracting for my fundraising efforts. I can&#8217;t say our company died because of this issue, but it certainly impacted us some.</p>\n<p>At the end of the period, we gave the IRS everything, and they said they will come back to us with the results later.</p>\n<h3>The Law Firm\u00a0Slaughter</h3>\n<p>I wished this was the end of my negative experience with the law firm, but unfortunately it was not. At this point, even though we were damaged badly by GD&#8217;s bad advice, I believed it all came out from an honest mistake from a junior lawyer who had no bad intentions. I didn&#8217;t want him to become penalized by this (since at the time I still regarded him as a friend and congratulated him on his new children), so as long I could survive through the turbulence, I would rather focus my energy on making my startup better.</p>\n<p>However, for one reason or another, the IRS took two years to come back to us and said the LLC owners were personally penalized as a result of the audit. At the time, we just closed our startup and were in very poor financial situations. I also just got married. It was an amount that was very difficult for us. Finally, feeling that I had no options, I reached out to that\u00a0corresponding lawyer (who is now more senior) and shared the conundrum I was in. I told him I still cared for him and didn&#8217;t want to affect his career, and asked for his advice on what I should do.</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t respond to my email, but to my surprised, a Founding Partner of the large law firm reached out to me and wanted to talk on the phone. At the beginning, he sounded very personable and understanding, but he pretended to be dumb, saying things like, &#8220;Well I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m allowed to talk to you directly without you having an attorney. Usually our insurance takes care of that.&#8221; There were many other points where he said he doesn&#8217;t know the regular procedure and defers to insurance &#8220;being the strict bad guys&#8221; while he was my friend. My other lawyer friend called BS on that later because as a Founding Partner at one of the most prominent law firms, he would have to know these rules of engagement. And if not, why was he the one that reached out to me?</p>\n<p>The Partner also pulled some\u00a0&#8220;Core Drive 5: Relatedness&#8221; punches such as saying that he wife was an entrepreneur and he totally empathizes\u00a0with how hard our jobs were). But at the end of the day, he said, &#8220;Well, this happened many years ago. And the Statues of Limitation says that if something is many years passed the event, you can&#8217;t come after us. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;\u00a0So I responded, &#8220;So we were penalized because we were trying to be nice and not cause troubles until we absolutely had to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just the rules. I didn&#8217;t make it.&#8221; (Btw, I&#8217;m just paraphrasing what I heard, but he was very careful to not leave an email trail in any of our conversations). After a few more back and forths, he said, &#8220;What if we just paid you $5000 and called it quits. Also, from the books it looks like you owe us $4,621 in legal fees from years back. We can cancel that too as good will.&#8221; I thought &#8220;Oh I had no idea that I owed them this amount since I never got a bill &#8211; wonder how they came up with that, but ultimately it&#8217;s the bill they are charging us for the service that got us screwed&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>I responded, &#8220;I really appreciate your offer, and would feel better about things because you guys decided to take responsibility.\u00a0Keep in mind that, since we like to be authentic and share our learnings\u00a0with other entrepreneurs, we wouldn&#8217;t proactively talk about this, but if others specifically asked us about you guys, we would share what happened\u00a0in a very fair manner, INCLUDING how you resolved it. I hope that&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said he can&#8217;t let that happen. If they&#8217;re doing anything at all, we need to shut up about it. He asked how much it would take for us to shut up. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about an amount, but finally said $25K. If you read what happened to the above (including disabling me from raising funding because of potential fraud penalties), you&#8217;ll see that $25K isn&#8217;t anything compared to the devastation that we went through because of them and is hardly a difficult amount for the company to pass out. Honestly, if I recount the 10 darkest days of my life, at least 4 of them was a result of their mistake. I don&#8217;t think I was being greedy nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p>He said no.</p>\n<h3>Two More Years of Pain</h3>\n<p>After that came a TWO YEAR process that went back and forth where I believe he was playing mind games and switching between being avoiding, passive aggressive, and accusing.</p>\n<p>He also said a lot of contradictory things. In one of the earlier calls, I said, &#8220;Well, I understand why you guys would have junior staff\u00a0work with startups that aren&#8217;t paying and minimize your work on those projects. I just happened to be burnt really badly because of that.&#8221; And he would respond, &#8220;No. Our company provides the best professional service to all the startups. We only advised you certain ways to help save you money and lower your legal costs.&#8221; But ten minutes later he would then say, &#8220;Well you weren&#8217;t a paying company, so why would you think we would provide this to you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also kept telling me how this is the first time they ever had a complaint like that, which turns out to be a lie because later I randomly met a mentor\u00a0who said his daughter&#8217;s startup also had a terrible experience with the same law firm and they treated her badly when she complained too.</p>\n<p>This I REALLY disliked, because whereas the initial issue I believe was a true honest mistake\u00a0that happened to be costly, this was pure dishonest manipulation.\u00a0That&#8217;s why when he eventually countered-proposed $10K, I said no. I wanted to hold firm on my number since I thought it was fair. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">It was a matter of principles and respect.</span></p>\n<h3>Final Crap</h3>\n<p>Of course, after two years of this crap I got drained. I no longer had the emotional energy to deal with it. Everything else in my life turned out to be very positive, but this was still an issue that made me cringe every time I dealt with it. I heard this was their tactic, drain you out so you give in. I was ready to give in.</p>\n<p>So I finally let go of principles and I compromised. On a new call, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll meet you in the middle. $15K.&#8221; And I finally said okay. I was relieved that I didn&#8217;t have to deal with this crap anymore. He said he&#8217;ll give me paperwork in a few days.</p>\n<p>Then suddenly, he disappeared again for weeks. I didn&#8217;t know what he was doing but he ignored my follow-ups too. Some mentors said he&#8217;s still playing mind games &#8211; he&#8217;ll probably do something unexpected again. After multiple follow-ups, he finally returned and said they were really busy so didn&#8217;t have the bandwidth to draft this up (which I found hard to believe since they had a firm full of lawyers). I looked at the contract, and it said they will pay us the $15K we agreed on, BUT <strong>every time we shared what happened to us to someone else we would have to pay $50,000.</strong></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable with this kind of imbalance, but again, I was really drained so I just wanted to get it over with. I agreed with the terms and was ready to get my past co-owners to sign it.</p>\n<p>This is when the Law Firm Partner suddenly wrote to me, &#8220;Oh I didn&#8217;t realize that you owed us legal money. How about this, we will deduct half of that from the $15K so it would become\u00a0$12,689.50 instead. If you can agree with that I can sign now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Honestly this was the last straw. He CLEARLY knew about the &#8220;unpaid legal fees&#8221; because he was the one that introduced it to me in the first place and even used it as a negotiation device. Now that we have finally agreed with everything, he pretends that he did not know it exists and tries to negotiate just a little bit more. Again, it&#8217;s not about the money but about the principle and about being disrespected after they accidentally put us in a bad position.</p>\n<p>A few things happened after that, but at the end of the day, I decided to fully let go of the whole thing. I was able to pay the IRS penalty on my own (with my wife&#8217;s help), and I decided I no longer wanted to be censored for my entire life in fear of being penalized $50K every time I slip. Plus, this is honestly a cautionary tale for all young entrepreneurs who just want to change the world but don&#8217;t know anything about dealing with legal service providers. And this is why I can happily share this experience here &#8211; it cost me $12,689.50 to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Don&#8217;t fully trust lawyer BS if it doesn&#8217;t make logical sense to you. (And be careful of &#8220;startup friendly&#8221; packages from law firms).</p>\n<h2><strong>1) Not caring about my health when being a workaholic</strong></h2>\n<p>Okay, the last one was way long so I&#8217;ll try to make this a straight forward one. When I was a young entrepreneur, I worked over 100 hours a week (40 hours to sleep, 28 hours to eat, restroom, shower, no social life, and the rest of the 100 hours working). I was young and felt invincible. My work was my game and I loved it. I ate microwave food and worked in bad postures. I did not smoke (at all) or drink much, but didn&#8217;t exercise much either.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it later all caught up to me. Even though to most peoples&#8217; standards, I&#8217;m quite successful, especially for someone who&#8217;s not even 30 yet, I also have a lot of problems with my health. I have chronic spinal pain that feels like electrical shocks on my spine. Occasionally my right shoulder would hurt as it if was burning. My knees have pain too and sometimes they would fail me when I&#8217;m just walking randomly. I have migraines that come on and off. And there&#8217;s other stuff.</p>\n<p>The reason why I&#8217;m not sugarcoating the severity of my conditions\u00a0is that I want people that are younger to know that THIS IS SERIOUS! My dad used to tell me that, &#8220;With your posture right now, you&#8217;ll later regret it when the pain comes in.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t believe him. Working with a laptop on my legs felt very comfortable &#8211; how can it be bad for my health when it&#8217;s so comfortable? I now SERIOUSLY regret that I don&#8217;t listen to him.</p>\n<p>Of course, every time I see an acupuncturist, chiropractor, or some other doctors, I would feel better. But after a few weeks either it would come back, or some other pain would creep up. Honestly, if it stayed like this my entire life, I would be okay about it. However, most people get these types of problems when they are in their 40s. If I start getting these pains when I&#8217;m 30, I can&#8217;t imagine how bad it would be when I&#8217;m 45. So for 2016 my goal is to seriously focus on improving my health and pay back the &#8220;debt&#8221; I accumulated over the past 10 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Your health is truly your greatest asset.

This award is based on the Rise.Global algorithm, community voting, and preferences of judges.</p>\n<p>This year I honestly wasn\u2019t optimistic on winning the award since I haven\u2019t been doing that hot on the Rise leaderboard throughout the year. Also, I felt that it would more interesting to the audience if there is a bit more variety for who the winner is. After all, there has been tons of other folks in the industry that are doing great and inspiring work.</p>\n<p>I was therefore truly surprised when they announced that I had in fact won the award. I felt deeply honored and wasn\u2019t sure what to say when I got the award. Hopefully it didn\u2019t sound too embarrassing.</p>\n<p>Then I decided to throw in some dance moves that I randomly did, which apparently people liked.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dlk97y2R9ws\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone for the amazing support you have continuously given me throughout the years. I\u2019m SO happy to see my work and Octalysis spread through the industries.

Most people don&#8217;t realize we are good friends (he even gave me a front cover endorsement quote for my book), but regardless of that I think his work on the Hooked Model is extremely actionable and insightful. I&#8217;m also planning to write a post in the future on how to analyze his Hook Model through the Octalysis Framework, which is quite exciting.</p>\n<p>Below I&#8217;m sharing a great post I read on his site, originally titled &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.nirandfar.com/2015/06/california-role-rule.html\" rel=\"canonical\">People Don\u2019t Want Something Truly New, They Want the Familiar Done Differently</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post is about how Americans were very uncomfortable with Japanese food and sushi in the early days until they could start off with the familiar ingredients of the California Roll. This is in line with Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&#8217;s Flow Theory, where if you make the difficulty curve too high at the beginning, it creates anxiety and users drop off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Flow2.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6190\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Flow2.jpg?resize=625%2C469&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Flow Theory\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Flow2.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Flow2.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Flow2.jpg?resize=624%2C468&amp;ssl=1 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Incidentally, this corresponds to Core Drive 5: Social Influence and <b>Relatedness</b>, as we only like things we can relate to. In fact, all jokes and media are a balance between that Core Drive and Core Drive 7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity &#8211; the balance between what we can relate to and a new surprise that creates curiosity or delight.</p>\n<p>I think this is very important for any behavioral designing creating any new experience.\u00a0Enjoy!</p>\n<h3>In Nir Eyal&#8217;s Words:</h3>\n<p>I\u2019ll admit, the\u00a0bento box is an unlikely place to learn an important business lesson. But consider the California Roll \u2014 understanding the impact of this icon of Japanese dining can make all the difference between the success or failure of your product.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever felt the frustration of customers not biting, then you can sympathize with Japanese restaurant owners in America during the 1970s. Sushi consumption was all but non-existent. By all accounts, Americans were scared of the stuff. Eating raw fish was an aberration and to most, tofu and seaweed were punch lines, not food.</p>\n<p>Then came the California Roll. While the origin of the famous maki is <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Who-invented-the-California-Roll\" target=\"_blank\">still contested</a>, its impact is undeniable. The California Roll was made in the USA by combining familiar ingredients in a new way. Rice, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds, and crab meat \u2014 the only ingredient unfamiliar to the average American palate was the barely visible sliver of nori seaweed holding it all together.</p>\n<h3>Familiar Done Differently</h3>\n<p>The California Roll provided a gateway to discover Japanese cuisine and demand exploded. Over the next few decades sushi restaurants, which were once confined to large coastal cities and almost exclusively served Japanese clientele, suddenly went mainstream. Today, sushi is served in small rural towns, airports, strip malls, and stocked in the deli section of local supermarkets. Americans now consume <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/sushi-industry-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">$2.25 billion</a> of sushi annually.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1521 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nireyal.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-16-at-3.55.06-PM-300x200.png?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"California Roll\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>The lesson of the California Roll is simple \u2014<em>people don\u2019t want something truly new, they want the familiar done differently</em>. Interestingly, this lesson applies just as much to the spread of innovation as it does to tastes in food.</p>\n<p>For example, the graphical user interface, a milestone in the popularization of the personal computer, used familiar visual metaphors like folders, notepads, windows, and trash cans to appeal to mainstream users terrified by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface\" target=\"_blank\">command-line interface</a> (perhaps even more than the thought of eating raw fish). The computer underneath was the same, however the familiar veneer suddenly made it accessible.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1519 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nireyal.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Apple_Macintosh_Desktop-300x200.png?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Apple's skeuomorphic design was the California Roll of the personal computer. &quot;Apple Macintosh Desktop&quot; by unknown. (Image Credit: Wikipedia)\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Quaint but unnecessary representations of the familiar became a hallmark of Apple products. As Claire Evans wrote for\u00a0<a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-eulogy-for-skeumorphism\" target=\"_blank\">Motherboard</a>, \u201cWhile under the direction of the late Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s design aesthetic tended heavily towards the skeuomorphic. The Apple desktop calendar, famously, is rendered with accents of rich Corinthian leather; its bookshelves gleam with wood veneers, its chrome always brushed, its pages stitched and torn, its tabletop felt green.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now that Apple serves a generation familiar with how its products work, it can shepherd them from California Rolls to sashimi, so to speak. \u201cWe understood that people had already become comfortable with touching glass,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/09/19/apple-jony-ive-craig-federighi/2834575/\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> Apple\u2019s Jony Ive. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need physical buttons, they understood the benefits.\u201d<!--more--></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1518 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nireyal.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_6747-e1434494486718-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300\" alt=\"Apple Passbook Wallet\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>However, Apple still uses its tried and true methods whenever the company wants users to adopt a new behavior. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2932541/apple-replaces-passbook-with-wallet-as-apple-pay-expands-to-u-k.html\" target=\"_blank\">rebranded Apple Wallet</a>helps users feel comfortable with the technology by making payment options look just like mini credit cards. Even though there\u2019s no technical reason to do so, Apple understands the power of the familiar.</p>\n<h3>(Un)Familiarity Breeds Contempt</h3>\n<p>As I wrote about in my book, <a href=\"http://www.nirandfar.com/gethooked\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hooked</em></a>, unfamiliar products and interfaces are more difficult to use and can impede adoption. Several <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion_(psychology)\" target=\"_blank\">psychological phenomena</a>\u00a0conspire to make us resist the atypical.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://bjfogg.com/fbm_files/page4_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">BJ Fogg</a> of Stanford\u2019s Persuasive Technology Lab, \u201cnon-routine\u201d is one of six \u201cElements of Simplicity\u201d \u2014 the factors that affect the likelihood of any particular human action occurring. Fogg wrote, \u201cWhen people face a behavior that is not routine, then they may not find it simple. In seeking simplicity, people will often stick to their routine, like buying gas at the same station, even if it costs more money or time than other options.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, we also have a love for \u201cnew and improved\u201d but in relatively modest proportions. \u201cNew and improved\u201d is great for things we are already familiar with \u2014 like cereal and dish soap \u2014 but not for products where we lack a frame of reference.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our aversion to things that are outside the norm is particularly hard on companies producing radical innovation \u2014 no matter how beneficial they may be. If using a new product does not feel familiar, it faces severe challenges. According Fogg, \u201cPeople are generally resistant to teaching and training because it requires effort. This clashes with the natural wiring of human adults: We are fundamentally lazy. As a result, products that require people to learn new things routinely fail.\u201d</p>\n<h3>What\u2019s Your California Roll?</h3>\n<p>When describing the Apple Watch, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come\" target=\"_blank\">Jony Ive said</a> his goal was to build \u201cthe strangely familiar.\u201d The smart watch is exactly the kind of innovation that is still too new for all but the most early of early adopters. And yet Ive obsessed over the details of the Digital Crown, an esthetic adopted from traditional watchmaking. Clearly, Ive knows what he\u2019s doing \u2014 industry <a href=\"http://www.slashgear.com/analysts-apple-watch-could-top-19-million-in-2015-08372629/\" target=\"_blank\">analysts expect</a> the company to sell 19 million units this year.</p>\n<p>As the pace of innovation accelerates, human behavior, not technological restraints, will be the deciding factor of whether products are adopted or discarded. If new products and services are to positively impact our lives, they must find a gateway into our daily routines. The <em>familiar done differently</em> is the way to users\u2019 minds and hearts \u2014 and sometimes their stomachs.</p>\n<h3>Here\u2019s the gist:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The California Roll introduced Americans to sushi by using familiar ingredients arranged in a new way.</li>\n<li>The California Roll Rule: <i>People don\u2019t want something truly new, they want the familiar done differently.</i></li>\n<li>Things that are truly new need to use familiar mental models to gain user adoptions (i.e., Apple\u2019s use of skeuomorphs.)</li>\n<li>Unfamiliar interfaces are more difficult to use and impede adoption.</li>\n<li>If your new product or service is not engaging users,\u00a0ask \u201cWhat\u2019s my California Roll?\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What do you think?</h3>\n<p>What was your familiar gateway into a new technology or product? Can you think of other companies who have used the \u201cCalifornia Roll Rule\u201d to introduce new products in a familiar way? Tell me what you think in the comment section below.</p>\n",

Even though I am not a fan of this term, it represents hardcore players that spend a sizable amount of money in a game (as opposed to Dolphins,\u00a0Minnows, and Freeloaders who spend significantly less money). Most gaming companies depend on these &#8220;Whales&#8221; to stay alive, and they try to design specifically for them.</p>\n<p>Some heavy gamers spend thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars on a game. When I was doing research on the game <a href=\"http://www.pennypop.com\" target=\"_blank\">Battle Camp</a>, I was amazed when I saw\u00a0<strong>some players spend $6,000 just on one weekly competition</strong> &#8211; not for any external reward, but just to win two &#8220;Legendary Monsters&#8221; that helps them play the game better.</p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered who are these heavy spenders and what goes on in\u00a0their heads? Are they just filthy\u00a0rich millionaires\u00a0who don&#8217;t care about money? Or are they so into the game that they are willing to lose their livelihood just to obtain more of those <a href=\"http://www.octalysis.com\" target=\"_blank\">8 Core Drives</a> we so desperately need in our lives? Are they\u00a0illusional and think that proud achievements in a game are more important than the real world? (Spoiler: in this\u00a0interview, we will see that this is not the case.) How do they feel about spending so much money on a game?</p>\n<h3>Big Jim: the &#8220;Whale&#8221;\u00a0who spent over $30K on We Heroes</h3>\n<p>When I started doing research on a mobile game my friend was working on &#8211; <strong>We Heroes</strong>, I also noticed many hardcore players who were not shy of spending real money in the game. On my server, <strong>the top player was named Big Jim</strong>, and he was setting and breaking all sorts of records in the game.</p>\n<p>Seeing how he has accumulated ALL the expensive heroes in the game, I was very curious about what he would be like in real life. After admiring his game status for a while, I had the opportunity to join his Guild, which led to us becoming friends on Facebook. To my surprise, he lives in Pleasanton, California, just twenty minutes away from where I live!</p>\n<p>After a few more months\u00a0of playing and communicating in-game (after all, I was no weak player either &#8211; doing some heavy lifting in the Guild too. And yes, I can actually expense my spending in-game as &#8220;research budget.&#8221;), we finally met at a conference, in which he graciously agreed to an interview.</p>\n<p>I then learned that he has spent over $30,000 on We Heroes alone! And this wasn&#8217;t spent over many\u00a0years like some\u00a0League of Legends players do.\u00a0Since We Heroes just launched in early 2015, <strong>the $30,000 must have been spent within a year&#8217;s time.</strong></p>\n<p>Below is the exclusive content of what goes through the mind of a &#8220;whale&#8221; heavy spender, and some lessons he wants the world to learn about.</p>\n<h3>Interview between Yu-kai Chou and\u00a0Big\u00a0Jim, a\u00a0&#8220;Whale Spender&#8221; on We Heroes</h3>\n<p><strong>I.\u00a0Yu-kai Chou:</strong>\u00a0<strong>Thanks so much for being part of this interview. Can you start off with a quick intro of yourself? Who you are, where you are from, and what do you do?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim</strong>: My name is Jim. I am a 55 year old electrical engineer working in Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p><strong>II. Yu-kai Chou: How many years have you been playing games for?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:</strong> I have played games since I was old enough to roll a die. I played my first war game when I was about 12. It was Blitzkrieg by Avalon Hill. My first MMORPG was Asheron&#8217;s Call.</p>\n<p><strong>III. Yu-kai Chou:\u00a0What are the games that you have considered yourself a hardcore player for?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:\u00a0</strong>Any game I like I play to win, which makes me hardcore to most people. Asheron&#8217;s Call. Everquest. World of Warcraft. World in Flames (a boardgame by Australian Design Group). Kingdoms of Camelot and now We Heroes. There may have been others I have forgotten.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Yu-kai Chou: In We Heroes, you are one of the top players in the game. When did you start playing, and how did you achieve the top status?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:\u00a0</strong>I saw an advertisement for We Heroes while playing another game so I tried it, and I liked it. It was sometime in early 2015 when server 12 opened. There wasn&#8217;t any great strategy involved in becoming a top player. All it takes is spending a lot of money.</p>\n<p><strong>V. Yu-kai Chou: I know you have spent over $20k to reach your status. Have you played any other game that you have spent a considerable amount of money?</strong><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:\u00a0</strong>I spent a lot of money on Kingdoms of Camelot. Before that the games I played cost more time than money. I spent a lot of time in World of Warcraft, Everquest and Asheron&#8217;s Call.</p>\n<p><strong>VI. Yu-kai Chou: What drove you to become a heavy spender in We Heroes, as opposed to the other games you played.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:</strong> I got sucked into spending a lot of money because I was competing with other players to reach the top of The Arena. At first I was just trying to get into the top 10. Then I got into the top 10, and I thought it wasn&#8217;t that much further to get to #1. Then I got to #1, and I thought &#8220;I&#8217;ll just get a little cushion to discourage other players from trying to take #1 from me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I was never able to get that cushion because Flash never quit spending money to keep up with me. Having already spent a lot of money, I wasn&#8217;t going to give up and let him take #1 from me so I just kept spending money.</p>\n<p><strong>VII. Yu-kai Chou: Do you consider the game developers unethical for causing you to spend so much money? Why or why not?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:</strong> Trying to get people to spend money is not necessarily unethical. Businesses have to do it to stay in business. Most of the time I consider it ethical but there are some exceptions. I consider it unethical to try to sell me something and to not tell me what the price is.</p>\n<p>Placing an employee mole in the game to compete with the top players would be unethical because the mole would not have to pay to play. I don&#8217;t think We Heroes has placed a mole on Server 12 but sometimes I wonder where Flash gets the money to keep up with me.</p>\n<p><em>[Yu-kai&#8217;s note: I later pinned my friend about this, and he assures me that Flash is a real player who has actually spent even more money in the game but was not as skillful as Big Jim. Perhaps the game still requires skill over just spending money after all. Even before this interview, my friend would ask me if I have also become friends with Flash on Server 12 since he was very curious about who this other &#8220;whale&#8221; was.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:\u00a0</strong>We Heroes does try to sell me stuff without telling me the price and I have complained to them about it. In their Wheel of Fortune there are approximately 18 spots on the wheel which appear to be equal sized. That implies that there is an equal chance that the wheel will stop in any one of those spots.</p>\n<p>The reality is, one spot has such a small chance to come up that I have never landed on it in over 5000 spins <em>[Yu-kai&#8217;s Note: each spin costs $1]</em>. If you advertise that you can win a prize by paying $10 per spin <em>[Yu-kai&#8217;s Note: Big Jim uses the &#8220;Spin 10&#8221; option, which means it is $10 each]</em>, and you allow it to appear as if the chance to win that prize is approximately 1 in 20 when the real chance is less than 1 in 1000, then that is unethical in my opinion.</p>\n<p>Kabam did the same thing in Kingdoms of Camelot. I don&#8217;t think this particular practice is rare. I complained to Kabam about it. I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint against Kabam because of it. I now refuse to play Kabam games because of it.</p>\n<p><strong>VIII. Yu-kai Chou: I noticed you spend a lot of time to study what enemy guilds do and how to improve your own and allied teams to win together. How much time do you spend on the game every day?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim</strong>:\u00a0It probably takes me an hour to do the crusade twice every day. I probably only spend 2 hours actually playing. When I&#8217;m not playing, sometimes I will be thinking about strategy. I also play on server 11 because I wanted to see if the game was as fun to play for free (it is) and because I would finish everything I could possibly do too quickly on server 12. I don&#8217;t play every day any more on server 11. If I am busy on server 12, I neglect server 11.</p>\n<p><b>IX. Yu-kai Chou:</b><strong> What is your favorite part in We Heroes, and what is your least favorite part</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:</strong> My current least favorite part is the crusade because, as a VIP player, I can do it twice a day. I always complete it. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I feel I need to do it</span> because I need the gold and the occasional rare item, but it takes a lot of time and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">it is no longer challenging</span>, which makes it a boring hour.</p>\n<p>My current favorite part is the guild war <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">because I am not guaranteed to win</span>. I deliberately did not try to form an invincible uber-guild with Flash. It is more fun to spread the power players around and have competition.</p>\n<p><strong>X. Yu-kai Chou: What is your proudest achievement in any game?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:</strong> Being one of the tanks for my raiding guild in World of Warcraft was probably the most difficult thing I ever did. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I don&#8217;t think of game achievements as something to be proud of. Games are just a way to pass the time and be entertained. Making the world a better place would be something to be proud of. I try to do that when I&#8217;m not playing games.</span></p>\n<p><strong>XI. Yu-kai Chou: What was the best money you have spent in a game, and what was the worst?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:</strong> The best money would be the money that gave me the most fun per dollar. That would probably be money spent on games like Sid Meier&#8217;s Civilization because I played that game a lot. World of Warcraft was good value for money when I played it.</p>\n<p>The worst money would be when I spend a lot of money for very little fun per dollar. We Heroes, while fun, has cost an insane amount of money. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">I should not have spent so much money on it.</span> Playing for free on server 11 has been good. (I accidentally spent $5 there once because I thought I was on server 12, but that is the only money I have spent there.) I have played maybe 100-200 hours on server 11 for $5. I have played maybe 500 hours on server 12 for maybe $30,000 (I try not to count how much I have spent.) Server 11 has obviously been better value for me.</p>\n<p><strong>XII. Yu-kai Chou: How do you fund your gameplay? Is it through salary, accumulated wealth from past work, family, or?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:</strong> I pay with salary and accumulated wealth from past work. If I hadn&#8217;t spent so much money on We Heroes I would probably be shopping for a new motorcycle. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Playing We Heroes means I will have one less motorcycle (at least) in my lifetime.</span></p>\n<p><strong>XIII. Yu-kai Chou: Many family members of my readers feel like my readers spend too much time or resources in games. What does your family and friends think about your dedication to games?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:\u00a0</strong>The time I spent in World of Warcraft was a problem for my family. I tend to spend too much time in games. I try to play games now that don&#8217;t require as much time. Resources aren&#8217;t a problem for me right now.</p>\n<p><strong>XIV. Yu-kai Chou: If you could give a piece of advice for readers who also want to be top hardcore players in a game like you, what would that be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:</strong> Set a budget (both time and money) and stick to it. Too much of anything can be bad for you. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Don&#8217;t try to compete with the people that spend too much time or money. It isn&#8217;t worth it.</span></p>\n<p><strong>XV. Yu-kai Chou: If the We Heroes team will end up reading this interview, what would you want to tell them? What would you like them to improve in order to make hardcore players like you happier?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:\u00a0</strong>Selling people items for outrageous prices by not telling them the true price will make you money in the short run but it will slowly turn your core players against you.\u00a0Other than that, the game is fun, so just don&#8217;t mess it up.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Don&#8217;t give the hardcore players too much of an advantage.</span> Keep the game fun for the free players. You need the free players so the hardcore players have somebody to beat up on, but <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">it can&#8217;t be too easy for the hardcore players.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Big Jim:</strong>\u00a0<em>[As a lesson to the We Heroes team,]</em> Kabam was much worse with the random prize stuff than the We Heroes developers are.\u00a0Kabam would sell a chest, for example the &#8220;Elite Gawain&#8221; chest. I would buy 1000 of them and tell my guild what the odds of each prize were so they could make informed decisions.\u00a0The next time Kabam would sell the &#8220;Elite Gawain&#8221; chest the odds would have changed. For example, the odds of getting the best prize might have dropped from 1 in 100 to 1 in 500.</p>\n<p>It really made me mad that they would sell the same item and change the odds. There was a valid reason for this. They were depreciating the value of items and creating better items as time went on to make people keep buying. I would still expect that the odds of getting the best prize should stay the same unless they told me they were different.</p>\n<p>Another thing Kabam did that upset me was they were constantly offering special deals where for 6 or 8 or 24 hours the odds of winning the best prize were &#8220;doubled.&#8221; Well, what good is it to tell me the chance is double for the next 24 hours when maybe yesterday you cut the chance by 75%. Maybe compared to the last time I bought that item the chance is only half as good, even though it is &#8220;double&#8221; for the next 24 hours.</p>\n<p>What I want We Heroes to do, is any time they have a gambling game, and the wheel of fortune is gambling, they say what the odds of winning each prize are.</p>\n<h3>What did you think about this interview?</h3>\n<p>As you can see from the above interview, Big Jim is not a rich illusional billionaire. He is a normal guy who loves games, worked hard as an engineer for many years, and using that income to buy himself entertainment. Some of us buy entertainment and status via luxurious trips, while others buy super fancy sports cars for over $100K.</p>\n<p>Here in Octalysis, we are not here to judge people&#8217;s motives, but to understand the psychology that drives peoples&#8217; behavior. Sometimes it is easy to form false perceptions of people who behave differently to what we consider &#8220;normal,&#8221; but it is those extreme cases where we can best study the <a href=\"http://octalysis.com\" target=\"_blank\">8 Core Drives</a> and how our environment (whether it is in a game or not) can influence us to take on seemingly irrational behaviors.</p>\n<p>Big Jim himself admits that he has likely spent too much money on We Heroes (per entertainment derived from the money spent), but his competitive spirit compelled him to WIN at large costs, as long as he could still afford it in his leisure budget. This leads to the next point:</p>\n<h3>NEXT: Yu-kai&#8217;s analysis of the interview through Octalysis Lenses!</h3>\n<p>Again, our goal is to understand the world and human behavioral through the 8 Core Drives of Octalysis. Next week we will cover some of my comments and analysis on the lessons we can learn from this interview through Octalysis Lenses, and how we can use these lessons to design more compelling experiences that benefit the real world.</p>\n<h3>COMMENT BELOW: Do you know any heavy spenders in games? I would love to hear about more people who are dedicated to their play experiences. Leave a comment below!</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Through this process, users will start to enjoy the activity so much that they will focus on relishing the experience itself without thinking about what can be gained from the experience.</p>\n",

Also, I wanted something to clear with a major Silicon Valley Law Firm that we had a detrimental history\u00a0with before sharing my experiences too publicly, but it became clear that this would take too long and I have given up (in fact, writing this post would cost me at least $13,000 because of that).</span></p>\n<p>But alas, the lessons from my failures could possibly benefit thousands of entrepreneurs out there, so\u00a0<span style=\"color: #000000;\">I&#8217;m taking the bold step forward to share what happened from my viewpoint\u00a0as well as some lessons learned during the process\u00a0(<a href=\"http://www.junloayza.com/startup-tips/premature-scaling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">for an account from my life-long friend and former CMO Jun, click here</a>).</span></p>\n<h3>An overview of RewardMe</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I was running RewardMe from 2010 to the end of 2012. It was generally bringing gamification into the offline retail/restaurant market through a digital loyalty program. Nowadays there are quite many of these companies, but we were the very first in the market\u00a0if you didn&#8217;t count FourSquare&#8217;s &#8220;Mayorship&#8221; system.</span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/41572443\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Our product metrics were great (<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/loyalty/rewardme-vs-belly-an-honest-and-fair-comparison/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actually 10x more than our competitors</a> based on what they published on their press releases), customers loved us, we were covered by large media sites including\u00a0Forbes and Business Insider. Towards the end of our reign, we closed a $1.5M deal with a big chain store that would allow us to deploy our product nationwide. We were also attracting many of the biggest chains, getting multiple meetings with top executives from Carls Jr, Subway, Swarvoski, and many more.</p>\n<p>We decided that going door-to-door was not the way to scale (I still believe in this today, even after seeing the traction of the top leaders in the industry who dumped tens of millions with only thousands of paying stores), but it&#8217;s to go through the big hurdle of closing large chains early and deploying nationwide quickly (since chains and mom-and-pops alike like to follow other chains, but not the other way around). That would give us a strong barrier to entry, as when our competitors realized they need to go after chains, we would be one year ahead and compounding our traction there.</p>\n<h3>Runway is Everything</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We however, did not raise a lot of money. We raised a bit over $1M to get to where we were when our competitors at the time already raised over $10M. I wish I had knew more about my own Octalysis Framework and the 8 Core Drives at the time, but since we did not come out of a famous incubator or had a celebrity startup team, fundraising was particularly difficult (so I guess a lesson here is:<strong> join a famous incubator if you can. It would increase your fundraising hype regardless how great you can get your company to become. The equity taken is peanuts when compared to decreased chances of dying</strong>). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Because of our stellar results mentioned above, the\u00a0investment/VC community was impressed with our execution,\u00a0but liked the door-to-door model better because it produced &#8220;predictable growth&#8221; such as &#8220;next week, 30 more mom-and-pops will signup.&#8221; They told us that just because VPs of gigantic\u00a0chains are taking 3rd meetings with us does not mean they will sign a deal with us, which was a fair statement.</span></p>\n<p>So towards the end of our runway, we finally\u00a0closed a $1.5 Million revenue deal with a large national chain brand, thinking it would get us our next round of funding. The big problem is, this two-year contract would at least take 6 months to implement and revenue collection had to come later.</p>\n<p>Most investors became interested and wanted to talk more immediately, but then got to a point where they still wanted to see &#8220;predictable growth&#8221; and would like to see the second and third big deal come in before they wanted to commit. To take some personal responsibility, perhaps I just wasn&#8217;t being a great salesperson and just didn&#8217;t close the deal (now I understand it as &#8211; I didn&#8217;t use any Black Hat Gamification/Motivation Techniques that drive urgency, but merely used White Hat Techniques that makes people feel good and trust me, but no urgency to act).</p>\n<p>During this time of fundraising, I was also heavily distracted because of a devastating issue that escalated\u00a0from some work\u00a0a &#8220;Top Silicon Valley Law Firm&#8221;\u00a0did for us (we can just call them GD). Even though I believe initially it was an honest mistake, instead of spending more time on fundraising, I was stressfully dealing with the IRS day in and day out for many months. To be fair, I know many entrepreneurs who have had a great experience working with this firm, but according to my own experiences and especially how they\u00a0dealt with it afterwards, I cannot recommend any entrepreneur I care about to work with them (email me if you want details &#8211; I&#8217;m scared.) Lesson here? <strong>Don&#8217;t take every sentence as truth\u00a0just because it came out of a prestigious firm &#8211; especially if you are on a &#8220;startup deferred payment plan.&#8221; Double check and use common sense.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At the same time, when we still had a few months of runway left, we realized how VCs liked the predictable mom-and-pop growth, but we didn&#8217;t think door-to-door was scalable (in fact we were rejecting small stores reaching out to us since we only had very limited resources and needed to focus on supporting the chain stores). We started to setup the first self-serve freemium program in our industry, hoping to capture our daily inbound leads.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At this point, we were at the end of our runway, and since we (or rather, I) couldn&#8217;t raise our Series A with the traction we had, we were in big trouble. Our existing investors however, were very excited and impressed about our progress and execution, so they committed a lot more money to get us to the place where we can close those other big chain stores\u00a0that are excited to sign-on but still waiting on the bureaucracy. Literally, our current investors were at the point of, &#8220;Hey, what was the wiring information you gave me last time? I can&#8217;t find it anymore but I&#8217;ll wire you the money as soon as I get it!&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><strong>However, this is when the Big Burnout happened in our company.</strong></p>\n<h3>The (Anti) Climatical Fall of RewardMe</h3>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Keep in mind, all our team members at RewardMe were hard working, smart, and passionate. They were some of the best people I have ever worked with. But to close this million-dollar revenue deal, many of these teammates worked over 100 hours a week in a high-stress environment, and most people were only paid 30% of their market rate (again, we raised a lot less than other companies. I myself NEVER drew a single salary from RewardMe). We all believed that, once we closed that large deal, we would raise that next round of funding, people could get paid better, and we could grow quickly like our well-funded competitors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When I was unable to close that next round quickly, it demoralized some of the key members on the team, and they felt it would be a never ending rabbit hole. Even if they did work for another 4 months with 110 hours of insurmountable stress every week, and even if that did lead to closing the 2nd or even 3rd big chain, they were no longer convinced that it would truly cause the &#8220;Come back with more&#8221; VCs to invest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Their concern was not unwarranted. I have many startup friends who kept surpassing their promised milestones but kept getting &#8220;come back when you hit this new milestone&#8221; from VCs for YEARS, even until the very moment they sell (which of course, the investors regrettably admitted they should have moved earlier). My teammates\u00a0were also uncomfortable with taking more money from existing investors because it would just lead them deeper into that rabbit hole of burden without a clear path to salvation. As a result, a few\u00a0key people\u00a0decided they needed to withdraw from this dark and overwhelming environment after sustaining it for many years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Even though this behavior was more than understandable, it obviously created big issues for the company. Remember our current investors were already asking me to send them the wiring information so they could give us more money? At that point I had a moral decision to make. I could give them the wiring information, take the money, and see what I could do with a few more months of runway (which would basically be trying to recruit people we couldn&#8217;t afford even with the new money). Or, I could tell them\u00a0the truth and face the consequences. I thought, &#8220;What would I prefer if I was the investor?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At the end, I decided to I disclose this information to existing investors that have committed the\u00a0money, and told them that this would\u00a0also make it more difficult to raise our\u00a0Series A\u00a0round. They thanked me immensely for being up front about it, and sure enough they decided to hold onto their money for longer to see what would happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At that point, without further investments and many of our key members burnt out, we had no resources to push forward. The quick conclusion was that, in order to not get into overwhelming personal debt, \u00a0we had to shut down operations immediately. We did not have any resources to do anything, including servicing or deploying our product.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">That was very unfortunate (and depressing at the time), because our online self-serve freemium model was just about to take off too. Over the next year, even though we have winded down and just looking to close the business, we continuously get businesses reaching out to us and saying, &#8220;We did our research, and we believe RewardMe is the best. How do we sign up?&#8221; At the time I could only painfully stall, &#8220;We&#8217;re working on a next version, so we&#8217;re no longer deploying the last one. We&#8217;ll let you know when it&#8217;s ready&#8221; since I was still\u00a0hoping that we could possibly revive the company again with a few free part-time volunteers. That did not happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Without any marketing or work over an entire year (besides the draining work of turning customers away), over 40,000 individuals/businesses clicked the &#8220;Get RewardMe Now!&#8221; button on our site, expressing they wanted to use RewardMe. To this day, I still believe we took the best strategy to win in the market, but just were not funded enough to execute on it. As mentioned earlier, other companies have spent tens of millions of dollars, but even the leaders have less than 8000 active customers (Of course, I also highly respect the traction they have obtained since I know how hard it is to grow in this market period &#8211; I wish them huge successes! I think they can still definitely win big by being acquired by bigger companies who want to buy their way into this space).</span></p>\n<h3>Aftermath of Closing a Dead Company</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Immediately after the Big Burnout, that was a very dark and deeply depressing time of my life. Amidst the\u00a0chaos, confusion, and helplessness, I realized that there was a TON of materials out there to teach startups how to become success, grow, scale, raise funding, find cofounders &#8211; but there was almost nothing out there to guide how an entrepreneur should fail (besides&#8230;.failing fast). There was no service, literature, or even emotional support for entrepreneurs trying to clean up a dead company, and it was extremely lonely. Many of my Cofounders have already moved on to new opportunities, but as the CEO of the company, I still had to worry about organizational structure, company debt, and disappointed investors. I secretly envied a little bit towards my non-CEO Cofounders (who are all still great friends with me today), because if we succeeded, our payout would be the same, but since we failed, I spent a significantly longer time dealing with the baggage and ramifications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I also spent a long time liquidating the assets to cover the company credit card debt (since I was trying to buy time to see if we could do a turnaround). One interesting thing was that during this time, a competitor reached out to us to discuss potentially acquiring us. That gave me a light of hope to at least return the money I raised from our investors. However, after a few discussions, the acquiring company revealed, &#8220;Actually, we&#8217;re mostly interested in your team talents [that stayed as free volunteers]. If we could just hire you guys with a GREAT compensation package, that would be ideal for us.&#8221;<br />\n</span></p>\n<p>This was yet again another ethical decision to make. At this point, I burnt out my savings, just got married, and I know my teammates were in tough financial situations as well. Could we try to justify years of uncompensated hard work? At the end, I told the company, &#8220;Look, <strong>there can never be a situation where we benefit immensely while our investors who believed in us become greatly worse off</strong>. If you are interested in us, give us a real offer that respects our investors too.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We understand and respect your loyalty to your investors. However, your individual payouts will be A LOT less because of your investor baggage, if that&#8217;s okay.&#8221; We responded, &#8220;That&#8217;s okay. Let us know when you figure out something that is\u00a0fair for both sides.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, at the end, the acquiring company&#8217;s investors couldn&#8217;t justify paying for our investors just to get us onboard as talents, so nothing happened (Oops, should have been more talented!). Annoyingly, after every effort\u00a0of protecting\u00a0our investors, a few smaller investors still became very aggressive on us, sending lawyers against us and really adding a ton of stress when I was already in this dark depressed time of my life. Luckily, I convinced them that there was nothing they could possibly gain from this that would even justify their lawyer fees, and they let it go.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some of my investors were AMAZING. The day I was supposed to call them and tell them the horrible news that I have likely lost their money, I had this fire burning feel in my head, to the point where I could even hear burning static noises. When I called a few of my investors and told them the news of how I failed them miserably, I expected them to yell at me for throwing away their hard earned money. <strong>But instead of yelling at me, a few investors immediately responded with, &#8220;Are you okay, Yu-kai?&#8221;\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I did not expect that type of kindness at all when it happened, and I secretly cried while reaffirming that I was doing fine and just trying my best to wrap up everything in a responsible manner. Those simple words probably changed a bit of\u00a0who I am forever. For that, I am forever grateful of DJ Martin and Vicki Young for being the best investors ever. If you could have them as your investors, it would be your best decision ever.</p>\n<p>Now, regarding the lesson here. You could see that I made a couple of big ethical decisions here, which didn&#8217;t really lead to beneficial results. The question here is, was that better or was that a mistake? I can&#8217;t really say as an absolute because everyone believes in different things and has different values. All I could say is, even if I had a greatly successful company, if I knew I got there by lying and cheating, I would not be a happy person. <strong>It would be a lot of money, a big house, and a nice car surrounding a piece of crap, and I would be that piece of crap. To me that isn&#8217;t worth it. Who I am is more important than what I have.</strong> Of course, since I try to be a faithful Christian, I also hold my accountability towards God and trust that things will work out in the end (which it did, as you will see later), even though there may be immediately short-term pains.</p>\n<p>I think that&#8217;s the best answer I could give to aspiring and struggling entrepreneurs in the field, but everyone has to find their own answers and find peace in their own hearts. Being a leader is about making the hard decisions and stomaching the emotional consequences. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not for everyone, and sometimes I&#8217;m\u00a0not even sure it is for someone like me.</p>\n<h3>Life After RewardMe</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So after all the stuff with RewardMe, I did some soul searching &#8211; what many people that have failed\u00a0in life do. I realized that throughout my life, a big problem I had was that all my ideas were considered &#8220;too early.&#8221; Ever since my first business in college, I would talk to VCs, and they would tell me what I was doing was ridiculous and wouldn&#8217;t work. I then decide to give that up and pivot to something else (after all, of course these grownups were smarter than I was). 3-5 years later, all the VCs were suddenly fighting to fund other companies with that very model I did earlier, but unfortunately I have moved on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When I approached them again with my new companies, they would say, &#8220;Yu-kai, your last business was actually right on! But your new thing here&#8230;.that&#8217;s just ridiculous.&#8221; And of course, the same things would happen again. <strong>If I was a celebrity entrepreneur, I could raise a lot of money for crazy and audacious ideas, and truck through a few years until the market caught up. I wasn&#8217;t, so I shouldn&#8217;t play by those same rules.</strong> This is important for all those new aspiring entrepreneurs that often read how companies raise tens of millions of dollars before launching a product on Tech Crunch. In general, if you can&#8217;t raise money just on your past exit records, you generally need TRACTION before you can raise significant money. Now how to get traction without the money you are raising is the difficult work of a resourceful entrepreneur.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Upon recognizing my tendency and problem, I realized I could adapt and adjust to that&#8230;no more crazy startups. Focus on what the world needs, not what it deserves (thanks Batman for bitter-sounding\u00a0thoughts haha).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I also thought about what made me happy, and I realized it was when I was creating gamified designs. The term &#8220;gamification&#8221; became more popular starting 2010, but I in fact have been working on productive applications of games and game elements\u00a0since 2003 (yes, one of those ridiculous things that would &#8220;never work&#8221;). I definitely had a lot of experience on it and was very passionate about it.</span></p>\n<h3>An epiphany in Gamification</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I looked around the gamification industry late 2012, and saw a few things. There were already many established &#8220;gamification experts&#8221; who had a brand name. Even though I spent ten years working on related projects, I did not have a name at all attached to gamification, because every inch of my muscle was used to push my startups and not myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">But then I noticed one interesting thing: the established &#8220;gamification experts&#8221; came from a variety of backgrounds: some were game designers, some enterprise software, some academic, some marketing. And I realized that I had one expertise that they did not have &#8211; Personal Branding. This is what you learn working in startups for so many years: in a startup you have no history, no name, and no resources, and you need to get it to the point where within 2 years, everyone knows about you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So I decided to use one of my expertise to promote my other. Very systematically, I got my blog traffic to go from 1,000 untargeted visitors/mo to 25,000 targeted visitors/mo within a year and a half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I published a gamification design framework that I originally created back in college called Octaylsis, and it really picked up. It was translated into over sixteen different languages with students reaching out to me from all over the world. The framework was unique in the sense that it went much further beyond the points, badges, and leaderboards (we call them PBLs in the industry) that most people thought gamification was, and derived motivation into 8 Core Drives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Some Core Drives were associated with White Hat Gamification (things that make you feel powerful and in control, but lacks a sense of urgency), while others were Black Hat (things that made you feel urgent, obsessed or addicted, but gives a bad taste in the mouth), and some Core Drives were related to Left Brain Oriented (appealing more to extrinsic motivation) while others were Right Brain Oriented (appealing more to intrinsic motivation).</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.yukaichou.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/The-Octalysis-Framework.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6122\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.yukaichou.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/The-Octalysis-Framework-1024x768.jpg?resize=625%2C469\" alt=\"Octalysis Gamification Framework\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/The-Octalysis-Framework.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/The-Octalysis-Framework.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/The-Octalysis-Framework.jpg?resize=624%2C468&amp;ssl=1 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">All in all, my life is going great these days and I do feel excited about waking up every day. I&#8217;m now recognized as one of the leading figures in the industry, speak/lecture at Stanford, TEDx, SxSW, Accenture and across almost all continents. Many VCs are asking me to help their portfolio companies with my new behavioral design (some of them call it behavioral engineering) knowledge. Instead of working on one project for over 100 hours a week, I get to simply do the thin slice of work that I enjoy the most for dozens of projects (and get some equity in them too).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This year I even published<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Actionable-Gamification-Beyond-Points-Leaderboards-ebook/dp/B00WAOGY4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430769587&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=actionable+gamification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> my own book, Actionable Gamification: Beyond Points, Badges and Leaderboard </a>that summarizes my learnings within the 12 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It sounds somewhat odd and even arrogant, but getting the results above was actually very systematic and even easy, especially compared to running a tech startup. Adjusting based on the lessons I&#8217;ve learned in the past, I was exponentially more successful revisiting stuff I did many years ago, instead of going after the new things in the future that I&#8217;m excited about (trust me, I&#8217;m holding myself back for many things that I believe would be world-changing).</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I think the lesson here is that, no matter how many successes or failures you have in your life, the key is to make sure you are always learning more about yourself, understanding your unique placement in the world, and do meaningful things that you are passionate about.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Wounds do mend. Success is never a given, but if you are spending every day of your life pursuing things that you are passionate about, the journey itself is what makes it meaningful, not the destination. Very few people I know have beaten the first Super Mario game, but they all have fond memories playing it. Life is not about winning (once you hit your goals, you just look for new goals anyway), but more about whether you are spending your time on things that bring it to the fullest.</span></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

This post may be moved into a Premium Area after a certain period of time).</em></p>\n<p>In the realm of fundraising, I regularly get approached by startup entrepreneurs who are looking for some support to help them navigate fundraising from angel investors as well as venture capitalists (I also get approached by many investors, but on an entirely different set of motivational challenges &#8211; mostly White Hat).</p>\n<p>The thing about investors is that they are generally motivated by the forces of greed and fear. The force of greed &#8211; the intense desire to make a billion dollars (Core Drives 2 and 4); the force of fear &#8211; the apprehension of losing all their money (Core Drive 8).</p>\n<p>At the beginning, the entrepreneur may promote many great attributes about the company, appealing to the investor\u2019s sense of Core Drive 1, 2, 4 and even 5 if there is a good social proof. (Here you see the value of remembering the numbers for each Core Drive. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t remember these numbers now, but just take note that they are mostly on the White Hat side of things.) The investor starts to show a lot of excitement, and the entrepreneur feels like the deal is sealed.</p>\n<p>However, as the investor gets closer and closer to writing a check, the fear of losing all their money begins to preoccupy them, which is driven by Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance. They start to ask for more metrics, traction, and further social proof. Often, six months go by, and still no funding is committed.</p>\n<p>From my personal experience, investors generally only close deals quickly when they are *convinced* that they will lose the deal if they don\u2019t commit. If an entrepreneur *convincingly* tells the investor that a lot of people are already in on the deal, and if the investor does not act this week the round will be full, only then will they finally react. Black Hat creates urgency and closes deals.</p>\n<p>When I was trying to raise $600,000 for my gamification startup straight out of college, I found the experience to be extremely difficult and sobering. We were a very young team, and this \u201cgamification\u201d thing seemed like a half-baked crazy idea.</p>\n<p>After struggling for awhile to raise a modest amount of money to keep our small team afloat, we were finally able to secure $650,000 from three investors. At that point, I wrote an email to all our potential investors, who for over a year continually \u201cwanted to see more\u201d and \u201cweren\u2019t sure about this gamification thing.\u201d I simply told them, \u201cWe are going to close the round, but thank you for your continuous (and non-existent) support!\u201d</p>\n<p>At this point, many of these investors who didn&#8217;t want to commit for an entire year suddenly responded with passion, enthusiasm, and even anger. \u201cYu-kai. I thought we agreed that I could invest this much money in your company. Why are you telling me that you are closing the round without me?\u201d I was thinking, \u201cWell, you kind of had an entire year to do that\u2026\u201d but they oddly made it seem like I was burning bridges if I didn\u2019t take their money.</p>\n<p>As a result, we tried to cap the round at $800,000 instead of $600,000, and we couldn\u2019t do it. We tried to cap it at $900,000 and couldn\u2019t. We tried to cap it at $1,000,000 and we still couldn\u2019t. Finally, I capped the round at $1,050,000, while rejecting some investor money, just to show that we were serious about the cap. (I\u2019ve also heard this same experience retold many times by other entrepreneurs.)</p>\n<p>This illustrates the irrational power of Core Drive 6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience as well as Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance (while also serving as a fine example of the limits of White Hat motivation). All these \u201cpotential investors\u201d clearly liked what I was doing. They were encouraged whenever I gave them good news. They saw that it could potentially make the world a better place. But they didn&#8217;t acted until they saw that the deal was being taken away from them. With White Hat motivation alone, people will always be intending, but never actually doing.</p>\n<p>For the curious, eventually my startup launched RewardMe, a product that gamified the offline commerce experience. RewardMe was performing eleven times better than the numbers our closest competitors published. (Sorry &#8211; since these companies are still in existence, I won\u2019t cite sources here in respect to their current success.) Towards the end of my time there, we even closed a $1.5 million sales deal with a national chain.</p>\n<p>Startups are risky, and the unfortunate thing is, just having a stunning product doesn\u2019t mean a company will be successful. A few years after RewardMe\u2019s launch, we hit a combination of personnel, funding, and legal issues. I stepped down as the CEO, and eventually the company folded. If only I had my Octalysis knowledge back then, many things would likely be different, which is why I am hoping my readers learn these elements on motivation before they run into issues in their own companies.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, by stepping down as the CEO of RewardMe, it freed up a lot of my time to further study gamification, human-focused design, and develop the Octalysis Framework.</p>\n<p>Today, even though my Octalysis Group organization is becoming busier and busier, I\u2019m a lot happier than when I was running a technology startup. That\u2019s because I am now mostly motivated by White Hat Core Drives, as opposed to the Black Hat Core Drives of constantly counting our runway before dying.</p>\n",

They are applying Octalysis to solve global climate change problems, and we love to promote efforts that make the world a better place. If you want to share a similar post, you can email victoria[at]yukaichou[period]com)</em></p>\n<p>Shigeru Miyamoto from Nintendo once said: \u201cFor those who don\u2019t <em>play video games</em>, video games are irrelevant. They think all video games must be too difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p>I say, same goes for fighting climate change.</p>\n<p>Life as we know it is about to end. Quite literally!</p>\n<p>Nowadays, everyone is busy in their own bubbles, whether it is sustaining a living, building a career or raising kids. We don\u2019t often look around to check what is happening around us. Even if we do notice major issues such as poverty, pollution, climate change, natural disasters, we immediately think, \u201cthis is out of my league, there is no way I could solve such issues, I prefer to stay in my bubble.\u201d</p>\n<p>But what if these major issues will start affecting your bubble? What if you can still move on with your same routine, same lifestyle and still help in solving one of these looming\u00a0and world-crushing dangers?</p>\n<h3>Confronting the Hard Truth</h3>\n<p>It is a fact that Global climate change is real and already starting to transform life on Earth. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes are breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted, and we already see the first climate refugees.</p>\n<p>So yes, life as we know it is about to end. Or as James Hansen &#8211; the famous NASA and Columbia University scientist &#8211; puts it: \u201cIf we continue, if we extract oil and burn that and emit that into the atmosphere, we are absolutely at game over with climate change.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s do something about it. In the Octalysis Framework, we know that Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling is a White Hat Core Drive, which means it is very powerful, but lacks urgency. People WANT to make the world better, but there is not immediate trigger to do it today. Core Drive 8: Loss and Avoidance is a Black Hat Core Drive, which means it motivates us immediately through the fear of losing something or having undesirable events happen.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how to use that Core Drive 8 to lead into Core Drive 1.</p>\n<h3><strong>Gaming and Climate Change</strong></h3>\n<p>Gaming and fighting climate change &#8211; \u00a0Have you ever thought what they might have in common? Most people see nothing! But if you look deeper, you will find the link.</p>\n<p>Gaming is all about problem solving, one of the motives that makes gamers enjoy playing video games is the sense of achievement and accomplishment they get when they pass a level or get a high score. This is Octalysis Core Drive 2: Development and Accomplishment, where we are driven be a sense of growth and desire to achieve targeted goals. So, what if you can take this sense of achievement to a whole new level and create an impact on a major global issue?</p>\n<p>Another important aspect is the power of the crowd! The gaming industry can motivate huge crowds and create a movement that can definitely make a difference. Humans have an innate, intrinsic desire to belong to a social group and exert influence socially (Octalysis Core Drive 5: Social Influence and Relatedness). When we see a group of people that we relate to spring into action, we want to participate and play our part in that group. In the same vein, not participating when other people in our group are, may result in a fear of missing out (Core Drive 8: Loss and Avoidance).</p>\n<p>Hence, as a gaming company or a gamer, you could do a lot about it actually.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fighting the New Dragon: Climate Change\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>Gamification is the next big thing. Games are no longer just about scores, building fortresses or fighting the dragon anymore; learning from successful games is now a very powerful tool for motivation, education, and spreading awareness. Several initiatives have already started making an impact through social gaming, which makes us strongly believe that global public awareness about the climate change issue could be significantly increased through Gamification. In fact, we believe that only a gamer could have what it takes to combat the new dragon, aka climate change.</p>\n<h3><strong>What steps does it take to fight Climate Change?</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>Did you know that the total electricity consumed by idle electronics equals the annual output of 12 power plants? There are many solutions that one could put in place. Starting from basic actions such as choosing greener computers and game consoles to activating the power management features on your computer. If we can present various ways for people to contribute to climate change, and let them choose how they will participate, they will feel empowered in their autonomous choice perception (Octalysis Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback).</p>\n<p>In addition, act as an ambassador to the cause and promote it among people you know (Core Drive 5: Social Influence and Relatedness). Awareness is the first step to <u>know</u> about the issue and <u>afterwards</u> start looking for solutions.</p>\n<h3><strong>WeForst: Planting\u00a0Trees\u00a0for every in-game behavior!</strong></h3>\n<p>As Oxford Scientists put it: \u201cTrees are the best technology to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere\u201d and that\u2019s what we are focusing on at WeForest.</p>\n<p>Our main mission is to fight climate change through reforestation and landscape restoration projects. Reforestation is not just about planting trees, it\u2019s a process of reviving a whole community with all its living organisms. By planting trees, you give new life for our Earth and for the community surrounding it, initially by absorbing carbon dioxide and by being a proactive tool in in meeting the international goal of avoiding\u00a0climate change greater than 2 degrees Celsius.</p>\n<p>Planting Trees adds to people\u2019s innate desire for progress (Core Drive 2: Development and Accomplishment). Every tree is like a reward that people can collect, and if grouped together the trees could form part of a collection set. Perhaps you can collect different kind of tree types: teak, mahony, oak, sequoia and get special powers if you complete a tree collection set (Core Drive 4: Ownership and Possession &#8211; we are driven by the feeling that we own something).</p>\n<p>At WeForest, we offer <em>trees as a currency</em> for companies to engage their millions of gamers. With this powerful tool, <strong>gaming companies may choose to plant a certain amount of trees for every gamer who passes a certain game level.</strong> With this, everyone will have his share in solving the problem, whether it is the gaming company, the gamer or the organizations. This is one idea of many other solutions.</p>\n<p>As we can see, fighting for our planet can be a well-designed gamified experience, using Octalysis Core Drive Motivational design.\u00a0We can all be part of this virtual movement and create a real difference. Let\u2019s collaborate and plant trees to make our Earth cooler and hopefully receive the message \u201cCongratulation. This story has a happy end. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Check our website to know more about our different reforestation projects (</em><a href=\"http://www.weforest.org\"><em>www.weforest.org</em></a><em>) and if you have any inquires or suggestions, please don</em><em>\u2019</em><em>t hesitate to drop us a message.</em></p>\n",

Games that enable the healthy expression of Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback, can offer intensely compelling experiences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One emerging and increasingly prevalent game design strategy focuses on providing\u00a0players opportunities to consider weighty moral choices.\u00a0This reflection leads\u00a0them on an inward journey to venture beyond the confines of their current perspective and mindset.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A related tactic involves creating situations where players are asked to perform seemingly simplistic actions that lead to consequences that force them to reflect on how their choices derived these outcomes. Again this strategy compels players to rethink their boundaries and definitions of their personal system of beliefs, expectations, and ethics.</p>\n<p>With both types of game designs, players are empowered to use their creativity to influence the course of the storyline. The consequences serves to provide feedback on their actions and decisions. This offers a very different and interesting experience from typical games that requires making calculated decisions that follow a pre-determined path.</p>\n<p>In these types of scenarios, right versus wrong is not simply a black and white distinction. As the player&#8217;s emotions strongly contribute to their decision-making and reflection, these strategies\u00a0add\u00a0a unique and interesting twist to game play.</p>\n<h2>What Is Meant By Moral Choices and Consequences?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Naturally, in every game, players have to make calculated choices which entail either desirable or undesirable results. But if you think about what real life is like, not all choices can be calculated. Consequences have to be anticipated by using imaginative foresight and they have to be judged according to a person\u2019s subjective set of individual values.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a story of a little boy who overheard two men kicking and physically abusing a fox. The dilemma is apparent: should he ignore the situation or step in to do something? Should the fox be sacrificed to ensure that one&#8217;s own safety is preserved by avoiding a potentially violent confrontation? Or should a person demonstrate the highest level of compassion by intervening on behalf of a defenseless animal?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As it turns out in this particular situation, the little boy decided to heroically jump in and grab the fox while kicking and screaming at the perpetrators. He succeeded in running away and bringing the fox to safety (FYI, this was a true story that was recently shared on social media).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Philosophers who seek to understand morality and our social dilemmas explore deeper and more extreme scenarios and questions that cannot be definitively resolved.</p>\n<p>One example is the question of the overcrowded lifeboat.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A ship struck an iceberg. Thirty people have to squeeze onto a lifeboat that is only intended to hold seven. Is it better to just let some of these individuals drown? This would cause the lifeboat to lighten and at least some of the people could survive. Or should all thirty people remain which would cause the entire lifeboat to sink and everyone die?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you can see with this type of situations, there is no clear right or wrong answer. The final decision can&#8217;t be easily calculated through sheer reasoning by way of left brain-styled thinking processes.</p>\n<h3>Moral Choices</h3>\n<p>There are many studies in psychology which show that people tend to be more receptive to a set of choices rather than being dictated a single option even if the outcome is better.</p>\n<p>For example, rather than getting into a power struggle with a child to eat their vegetables, a parent can use a savvier form of communication by asking them if they want to eat their broccoli before or after dinner.</p>\n<p>In a game setting, giving players choices makes them feel more empowered. And giving them options that can\u2019t simply be calculated empowers them to use their creativity to choose the right course of action. This sort of decision is based on what they subjectively value rather than weighing neatly defined options, such as good versus bad, or gain versus loss.</p>\n<p><span class=\"il\">Yu</span>&#8211; <span class=\"il\">Kai</span>\u2019s upcoming book, <em>Actionable Gamification- Beyond Points, Badges and Leaderboards</em> discusses one game design technique where meaningful choices are presented which serves to empower the creative thought processes of players and their drive towards positive feedback.</p>\n<p>Most people will easily say that they would do anything for their child. But when it comes down to a real life situation, how far would they actually go? In the game Heavy Rain, Ethan Mars, the main character, is faced with the decision to cut off his finger in order to save his kidnapped child\u2019s life.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J9K_T_klwRQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>When faced with uncalculated pressing moral choices, this type of game designs engages the player\u2019s emotions which causes them to make choices that are not based on clear cut logic. And they may start to question their personal beliefs and values.</p>\n<h3>Consequences</h3>\n<p>To recap, difficult choices can cause the player to deeply consider his/her decisions before or while they are performing\u00a0an action. But another type of game design may cause players to think about the impact of their actions after the fact, once they experience the consequences of their decisions.</p>\n<p>One example is the game,\u00a0<a href=\"http://goodmorningcrono.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chrono Trigger</a>. Players are required to perform seemingly meaningless actions that they don\u2019t give much thought to (e.g. helping a girl find her cat). But unbeknownst to them at the time, the cumulative effect of their actions carries a significant consequence, especially when they are judged as guilty or innocent at the time of their trial. This can come as a real surprise which forces them to reflect upon the chain of events which led to their current circumstance.</p>\n<p>Another game, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/WitcherGame\" target=\"_blank\">The Witcher</a>,\u00a0employs a time delayed system where the consequences of a player\u2019s decisions are not known until much further into the\u00a0plot. Their choices also affect the course of events in the actual story. This offers a rather different experience compared to the more simplistic moral paradigms of typical role playing games. Good and evil is not clear cut, rather decisions are made from the perspective of choosing the lesser of two evils.</p>\n<h2>Blending Moral Choices and Consequences in a Game</h2>\n<p>The game design strategy of letting players have an impact on the story does not have to be restricted to choices or consequences, to the exclusion of one over the other. After all, being faced with needing to both make heavy choices and\u00a0feel\u00a0their consequences is the nature of real life.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is certainly possible to weave in both elements to maximize the impact of the game.</p>\n<p>In the game <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/50300/\" target=\"_blank\">Spec Ops</a>, the setting is a city that is about to get destroyed by nature. The main character is a man who must come to terms with the consequences of his horrendous actions. Players must face decisions that they never thought they would have to make and the lines between good and bad become quite blurry. At certain moments, players may be aware of the choice they need to make while at others, they are forced to understand its consequence.</p>\n<p>Using consequence in a game design should not focus on simply punishing the player for bad actions, like a child being grounded or sent to the principal\u2019s office. Ideally, they should sincerely feel the weight of their decisions and be forced to think beyond boundaries of the assumptions that they normally operate by.</p>\n<p>How to employ consequence design as a strategy can be quite tricky. It may be perceived as unfairly punitive and this can rob players of their sense of control to the point where they just dismiss the game.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that a sense of empowerment through Core Drive 3: Creativity and Feedback and also the other player drives of Octalysis is what makes a game compelling and thoroughly engaging in the mind of the player. \u00a0The thoughtful use of choices and consequences can serve to create an undeniably provocative experience in the end.</p>\n",

At the beginning I was looking for a variety of Gamification platforms to experiment and research on, and most of them either required too much setup know-how (I am not a programmer), or is very limited in what can be customized.</p>\n<p>My friend <a href=\"http://www.gamified.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andrzej Marczewski</a> recommended Captain Up to me and since I respect his opinion I decided to give it a try.</p>\n<p>The setup only took a few minutes, and then I spent a couple hours customizing it to create challenges and language that fits my site. I even documented my thinking process <a title=\"Gamification Design\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/yukai-chou-gamified-gamification-blog/#.VO-MuFPF_j8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in this blogpost</a> (as well as <a title=\"Book on Gamification\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-book-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">my upcoming book</a>).</p>\n<h3>Too friendly and enjoyable to quit</h3>\n<p>The team at Captain Up then reached out to me and asked if I needed more support. They proactively helped me on all my questions and needs, and it actually created a lasting impression: &#8220;Wow, I would love to work with these guys at one point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After a while, I was ready to move on and study other Gamification platforms, but then I realized that my readers loved the current Captain Up one so much, they kept on asking for more challenges and tried to level up more. Many would say they were trying very hard to level up or reach the top of that week.</p>\n<p>That was to some extent expected, since the design is meant for people to fall in love and stay engaged with the experience, but it nevertheless gave me great emotional encouragement, so I decided to just stick with it and use it for my blog.</p>\n<h3>Making videos for Captain Up</h3>\n<p>Eventually Captain Up asked me to make some videos to explain to people how to use their platform better, so I made a short series of <a href=\"http://blog.captainup.com/introducing-the-engaging-website-design-series/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gamification Videos called the Engaging Website Design series</a> for them.</p>\n<p>They were made in similar style to my <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/video-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification Videos</a>, but with a strong focus on HOW to do these things via Captain Up.</p>\n<p>It was useful because I regularly get questions from my own readers on how to use Captain Up better, so now I have a great place to refer them to.</p>\n<h3>Taking Captain Up to New Heights</h3>\n<p>Even though Captain Up is a great platform, they are still very young and still trying to cover all the amazing features that people want. Since I am using their platform and my readers all depend on Captain Up to create more enjoyable experiences, I thought I should get involved with how the product evolves and how they incorporate sound principles of my Octalysis Framework.</p>\n<p>Because of that, when they reached out again to talk to me, we quickly reached an agreement where I would try my best to help them become a great platform and something that can implement all the Core Drives via unpredictability, meaningful choices, and social platforms.</p>\n<p>This is an exciting journey. As my own company The Octalysis Group is growing substantially, I don&#8217;t know how long I will be able to stay committed to Captain Up, but as of now I&#8217;m looking forward to make them as successful of a company they can be. Hopefully my involvement will help turn them from a great product/platform to a great company.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

However, this is not the experience of most kids in conventional schooling systems. Reading and math can be frustrating for a child who does not understand the underlying concepts or the larger picture of what they are learning. In many cases, students are structurally encouraged to just\u00a0rote memorize information and simply go through the motions by following the school curriculum. Without establishing the right building blocks and foundations for comprehension and critical thinking, school can become even more daunting as courses become harder as the student rises through\u00a0the grade levels.</p>\n<p>However, by integrating imagination, creativity and game mechanics with the desired information, knowledge can come to life in meaningful ways. Compared to traditional grading systems, this offers a far more effective way to inspire the core drives of Core Drive #2, Accomplishment &amp; Development as well as Core Drive #3, Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Immersive game environments can incorporate visual, auditory, and tactile modes of exchanging information with players, which creates an interactive learning environment where engagement is key to success.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rewards gained from feeling an internal sense of real achievement and having the ability to creatively solve and master challenges becomes far more meaningful in this type of learning environment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And with games, it is also possible to effectively utilize other forms of motivation such as Core Drive #4, Ownership &amp;\u00a0Possession and Core Drive #5, Social Influence &amp; Relatedness to further enhance the experience of players\u00a0and add a greater sense of personal meaning and significance to what they are learning.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are five examples of educational games that are transforming the way kids are now learning in school.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><!--more--></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Timez Attack</h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zCHK52hxIJ0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conventional way of teaching multiplication tables is through the use of flash cards. This is perhaps the prime example of rote learning used in conventional schools. No one really enjoys mindless memorization tasks but its considered effective for making basic information stick. But learning multiplication sets does not have to be so painful. The game,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bigbrainz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Timez Attack</a> demonstrates a better way for kids to master this basic math skill.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The graphics of the game are done in 3D animation and the story takes place in a castle-like setting. Automatically, this puts kids in the mode of playing an immersive, adventurous video game.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The player is required to demonstrate their visual understanding of simple problems like 2&#215;2 by throwing sets of numbers at a wall. They have to figure out how many number sets equate to the multiplication problem. Getting this right is an example of Core Drive #3, Creativity &amp; Empowerment of Feedback.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Periodically, an ogre comes out to help jog the player\u2019s memory of previous multiplication questions and to reinforce the long term memory of these problems. Getting past the ogre by coming up with the right answer helps players feel a sense of Core Drive #2, Accomplishment &amp; Development as they become more confident in their mastery multiplication tables.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. Raz Kids</h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G-fpgTF7GQU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.raz-kids.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Raz Kids</a> is an animated e-book repository where very subtle forms of game mechanics are woven in. Reading is something that many kids struggle with throughout their school years. Without establishing the right foundation, it can become ingrained as an unpleasant chore.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Raz Kids is designed to first help students master sight reading and phonics in an interactive fashion. The game includes a microphone feature where they can record themselves as they read. This is can be saved for parents and teachers to listen to and provide their feedback (Core Drive #5, Social Influence &amp;\u00a0Relatedness). But it also gives kids a chance to step back from their focus on sounding out the words. They can then hear themselves read and then process the concepts being conveyed by the words.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Quizzes to test and reinforce comprehension are also offered. Students earn stars as they pass through quizzes. These can then be used as online currency to buy virtual items which can be used to personalize their rocket clubhouse (Core Drive #4, Ownership &amp; Possession).</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Boom Writer</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How would one teach children to love writing and to develop their creative skills in this area?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://boomwriter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Boom Writer</a> offers the opportunity for kids to create stories and build upon their abilities through online collaboration. It is largely driven on Core Drive #5, Social Influence &amp; Relatedness.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Published guest authors from the site contribute story starters. Students in a class would choose one of these starters and write additional chapters. Teachers are able to view these submissions and make suggestions and edits as needed. The chapters are read to the class (without names being revealed) and the students vote on which ones to include in the final book which can then be made available for sale in the Boom Writer stores (Core Drive #2 and Core Drive #4).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the students whose entries make it into the book, Boom Dollars are awarded. These can be used to buy accessories for their personal avatar on the site (Core Drive #4). Each profile also displays scores such as the number of books they published, how many entries they&#8217;ve made, and the votes they&#8217;ve received from their peers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To learn more about how Boom Writer works, watch this video:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEnlHx5YrQE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Frequency 1550</h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOpsTvSJsZ0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://7scenes.com/projects/frequency-1550/\" target=\"_blank\">Frequency 1550</a> focuses\u00a0on teaching history to middle school students. It uses a combination of mobile and GPS technology to integrate historical sites in Amsterdam with actual learning goals which are part of a larger school curriculum.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The overall objective of Frequency 1550 \u00a0is to complete as many assignments as possible in order to win points (Core Drive #2). This includes tasks like\u00a0answering questions pertaining to various locations and\u00a0creating relevant media in the form of videos and photos (Core Drive #3).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the students engaged\u00a0in this interactive game, researchers at the University of Amsterdam and the University of Utrecht compared their mastery level of the curriculum by observing the learning performance of the kids who utilized Frequency 1550 with those who were given more traditional\u00a0curricula.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The results showed that the students who were taught the history course through the mobile/GPS technology actually remembered more and demonstrated much higher levels of learning compared to the control group.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5.\u00a0Dinorama</h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EI_99pCNpLc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For kids who wish to make a dream or idea a reality, understanding the objectives and skills of entrepreneurship is quite important. And the earlier one learns these lessons in life, the better. What better way is there to impart these principles than through a game setting?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.geekswithjuniors.com/blog/2013/10/11/dinorama-teaches-entrepreneurship-to-kids-through-business-s.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dinorama</a> is a fun app where players take on the role of running a dinosaur park (Core Drive #4). Not only do they get to feed and care for these animals, but they also learn valuable financial concepts such as earning\u00a0interest by keeping their money in a bank,\u00a0defining necessary versus nice-to-have expenses,\u00a0maintaining an emergency fund for unpredictable events,\u00a0modifying spending when there are fewer customers (i.e park visitors) or increases in the cost of food, and\u00a0purchasing inventory in bulk in order to get volume discounts.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While most educational games for kids are based on White Hat core drives, Dinorama is somewhat unique by enabling the inclusion of Black Hat Core Drives that are intrinsic to the experience of running a business, such as Core Drive #6, Scarcity &amp; Impatience, Core Drive #7, Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity, and Core Drive #8, Loss &amp; Avoidance.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These variables help kids learn how to plan for and mitigate real world consequences by taking appropriate actions in the present.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Value and Challenge of\u00a0Education Gamification</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Games are excellent tools for supplementing the way information is taught in school. Through imaginative contexts and the use of game mechanics, what was once perceived as boring comes to life in new ways. However, the inclusion of a gamified curriculum should not completely obliterate traditional reading assignments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paul Anderson, an AP Biology teacher in Montana discovered that although his use of gamification helped students easily master complicated concepts, they remained weak in reading comprehension. Games are simply intended to illustrate certain concepts in more engaging ways. However, students will still be faced with complex reading materials at the university level and even in their careers and cannot always depend on the availability of fun games to help them excel.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is also recommended that in a gamified educational setting, students are also asked to create their own game designs to exercise their ability to reframe dry subject matter in more imaginative ways.</p>\n",

The series, which is hosted by TechnologyAdvice\u2019s Clark Buckner, explores a variety of business and technology landscapes through conversations with industry leaders.</p>\n<p>Yu-kai joined Buckner to discuss his book, how he ensures his team is on the same page, gamification implementation, and how gamification and B2B technologies connect.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/197683276&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Here are a few of the highlights from our conversation:</p>\n<p><b><i>TechnologyAdvice: There are some CRM solutions that have an 80 percent failure rate, either because it\u2019s not implemented correctly, or because the goals were never mapped out to begin with. How do you get your team on the same page at the very beginning to get their goals and their strategy in place?</i></b></p>\n<p><b>Yu-kai: </b>At the beginning of every gamification campaign, I always let clients to define five things\u2014 what I call the strategy dashboard.</p>\n<p>The first one is business metrics, which lead to the game objective. What are the metrics you actually want to improve? What&#8217;s your most important metrics? What&#8217;s your number two? What&#8217;s your number three? It&#8217;s amazing how, when you change the order of these business metrics the entire experience design completely changes.</p>\n<p>That leads to the game objectives. This is why you\u2019re gamifying something. If those numbers go up, it&#8217;s successful, if they don&#8217;t go up, the campaign\u2019s a failure. And then you want to define who the users are and their player types.</p>\n<p>And then the third one is desired actions that lead to win states. Those are all the little steps the user needs to do for you to be successful. And every time they do the desired action, it needs to be a win state.</p>\n<p>The fourth one is feedback mechanics that lead to triggers. So feedback mechanics are things people can see, in terms of communicating those core drives; each of these feedback mechanics needs to trigger the desired actions defined earlier.</p>\n<p>And finally, its the rewards and incentives. Basically, if users hit the win state, what are the rewards that you can give them. This is a very precise and tight-knit process, but once those things are defined, the whole team is together. There&#8217;s clear language about what&#8217;s a priority.</p>\n<p>And I don&#8217;t think I need any more than that. Usually within a few days we can get this flushed out. And then the rest is just designing a great experience.</p>\n<p><b><i>TA: Gamification implementation with different technologies starts out very simple, and then builds. Once you understand what motivates somebody, you can use that in a way that ensures you&#8217;re going to get the desired action. What connections do you see between gamification and B2B technologies like CRM or marketing automation software?</i></b></p>\n<p><b>Yu-kai: </b>The core of gamification is delivery experience, where people will take the desired action. And we know every time they take an action is because of the 8 Core Drives.</p>\n<p>But you need to be able to send them feedback mechanics to trigger these desired actions. So marketing automation software is very useful in this case because it provides triggers. BJ Fogg says that every behavior is because of motivation, ability, and a trigger.</p>\n<p>So <a href=\"http://technologyadvice.com/marketing-automation/smart-advisor/?tid=TECHCONF-ma-expertinterview-yukaichou/#guide\">marketing automation software</a> makes sure it&#8217;s constantly sending users the right triggers at the right time. It&#8217;s intelligent, it says, &#8216;Hey, it&#8217;s been two weeks!\u201d or \u201cThis just happened!\u201d or if something just appeared in the news, &#8216;Hey, don&#8217;t forget about us.&#8217;</p>\n<p>And then the content of that email message will be the motivation part. That&#8217;s when you think about, am I motivating them to take the next desired action? &#8216;Hey, look, 80 percent of fortune 500s are using us.\u2019 That, or scarcity or exclusivity\u2014 like there&#8217;s only three spaces left.</p>\n<p>You want to think about what goes into that automated email. But as long as the user can see the email, that&#8217;s the trigger, there&#8217;s the motivation, and hopefully every email has an action item, a link or something the user can do. That&#8217;s when behavior happens.</p>\n<p>And you can craft that experience to be fun, engaging, emotional. Woo.com for instance, is famous for using fun and exciting, and kind of unrandom, unpredictable language to sell really serious things and they make the experience playful. I recommend companies who do that a lot.</p>\n<p>How do you add a little bit more of unpredictability to your automated marketing messages? How do you add social influence, how do you add scarcity?</p>\n<p>To learn more about Yu-kai Chou visit<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/\"> Yukaichou.com</a>. \u00a0His LinkedIn account is Yu-kai Chou while his Twitter account is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yukaichou\">@Yukaichou</a>.</p>\n<p>Listen to the entire show above in order to hear our full conversation, or <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ta-expert-interviews/yu-kai-chou-actionable-gamification\">download here</a> to listen later.

Become\u00a0a guest author on my\u00a0blog! Please write to me\u00a0if you&#8217;re interested.</em></p>\n<p>You know you\u2019ve thought about it. We all have.</p>\n<p>You imagine some ne\u2019er-do-well purse-snatcher creeping up behind an unsuspecting woman, and sprinting away with ill-begotten goods.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s next? You spring into action, maybe yelling out some pithy admonition as you chase down the assailant. You revel in the applause as you detain him and return the purse.</p>\n<p>Or maybe, you imagine yourself on your morning commute, happening to notice someone sitting listlessly on the edge of the bridge, looking out at the morning waters ripple and lap at their feet. You, without even a thought that you\u2019re going to hold up traffic, rush to their side and talk them down from their attempt to solve temporary problems with a permanent solution. As you tearfully embrace, the bystanders in their cars look on in admiration.</p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t thought about it all that personally, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that &#8211; think about your favorite movies, your favorite books. Literature and film are littered with people cut from the heroic cloth, bettering the lives of those around them\u2026 and sometimes even saving the world.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s irresistible, right? The draw of the heroic call.</p>\n<p>It would be tempting to think that this is the result of our recent glut of superhero films, or things like The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, &amp; The Lord of the Rings. It\u2019s tempting to think that it\u2019s just part of the 21st century culture we\u2019ve grown up in. But is it, really?</p>\n<p><b>YOUR PLACE IN MANKIND\u2019S ONE GREAT STORY</b></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s examine our belief for a second. We won\u2019t have to think about it much longer than that to recognize that every single human civilization in history has hewn closely to their love of heroism. Classic tales like Horatius at the Bridge &amp; (others) have captured the imagination and the attention of historians for centuries.</p>\n<p>One particular historian, Dr. Joseph Campbell, once published a book in 1949 called \u201dThe Hero With a Thousand Faces\u201d, which contained insights that he had gleaned from researching folklore, myths, and tales from every manner of world culture. His discovery is obvious, and ubiquitous &#8211; and yet we often miss our place in it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s called \u201dThe Hero\u2019s Journey\u201d, and it was the culmination of Dr. Campbell\u2019s search for patterns in world cultures from Babylonian antiquity to contemporary stories.</p>\n<p>There is a staggering amount of overlap between even the most seemingly different of cultures in the way that they share stories of virtue and valor. The Hero&#8217;s Journey is that overlap. And you\u2019re right in the middle of it.</p>\n<p>The same myths, told a thousand different ways. A single hero, with a thousand different faces. One of those faces is yours.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><b>WHO, ME?</b></p>\n<p>Yes. You, right there. Sitting at your computer or staring at your phone.</p>\n<p>Has it ever really occurred to you that you\u2019re the main character in the story that is your life?</p>\n<p>Have you ever thought that you might be living out an underlying narrative with twists and turns? That maybe, if you were to think about it, that you\u2019d have the tools to decide how it\u2019s told?</p>\n<p>The undercurrent that ties together all mythology, all legend, and modern epics is <i>the same</i> amongst all its variations because it is a <b>human undercurrent.</b></p>\n<p>Our love of stories is renewed and revived at a constant because <i>we, as humans</i> reflect on our shared experience with symbolic stories of our human lives.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll get to the actual roadmap in a minute, but this is crucial to understand. You\u2019re a human, living a challenging life in a challenging world, full of choices, and passions, and purpose. It might NOT always feel like that, over there where you are at Point A. At Level 1.</p>\n<p>But there is a Point B. A Level 50. And I\u2019ve got the thousands-of-years-old-map, rolled up in my hands to show you. Let\u2019s look at the first step:<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><b>HEROIC IMAGINATION</b></p>\n<p>Children love superheroes, and know that equipping themselves with a Superman costume is perfectly OK. They feel like they might even be able to fly.</p>\n<p>And then, some of those unfortunate souls grow up and realize that they don\u2019t possess the power to fly, or that they don\u2019t have Iron Man\u2019s billions of dollars in weapons technology to attain it. We lose our relationship to heroes, we drift further away from thinking of <i>ourselves</i> in those terms. It gets set aside as \u201dkiddy stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>The problem is that the world has never been without a need for heroes, people who will stand in the gap, people who are willing to rush to the aid of those in danger and live with integrity. The need grows greater for men and women of integrity and action to step into the fray and offer their impact for the course of the world.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong>Dr. Philip Zimbardo (of Stanford Prison Experiment fame) recently took up the task of sorting out what helps men to move from cowardly inaction, to heroic action. We can talk more about him later, but the conclusion that he and his research partner Dr. Zeno Franco arrived at is an almost trivially obvious first step: <b>heroic imagination</b>, here defined:</p>\n<p>\u201dThe capacity to imagine facing physically or socially risky situations, to struggle with the hypothetical problems these situations generate, and to consider one\u2019s actions and the consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p>In other words, it\u2019s more a question of <b>identity</b> than anything. It\u2019s seeing yourself as a hero and imagining what the \u201dheroic\u201d thing is to do, before you have to do it. How do we cultivate this mindset?</p>\n<p>I can think of one way that bolsters heroic imagination above all others. Can you guess what it is?</p>\n<p><b>HERO TRAINING.</b></p>\n<p>Video games. Story-driven, narrative-and-plot video games where you play as the hero.</p>\n<p>You might be saying \u201dSeriously, Tim? You\u2019re asking me to think about being a hero and then to play video games? How is that going to help?\u201d</p>\n<p>To which I\u2019d mention the difference between video games and other media. Video games are the only medium that is incomplete without its audience. A book, written once, will be the same forever. A movie, played in front of a crowded theater, will be the same movie years from now on the TV late at night with nobody watching.</p>\n<p>A game? Not only is it nothing without the player, but it becomes something different whenever anybody new plays it. And sometimes it becomes something new when one person plays a game multiple times.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the only form of entertainment which changes based on the person interacting with it. <b>In all other media, the audience is merely that &#8211; audient. In games, the audience is integral and participatory.</b></p>\n<p>This links you together with the hero as you traverse through the story, in something called the Player-Protagonist connection. You identify with the characters over whom you have agency. The less they speak, the more your thoughts fill in their words; the more agency you exert over their actions in the game, the more you take ownership of them.</p>\n<p>When I was 7, one of my favorite games was an SNES classic called Super Castlevania IV, about a burly whip-wielding warrior from a long line of vampire hunters, on a quest to subdue and thwart the infamous Dracula. But when I played that game, <b>I </b>was the brave warrior combating against the forces of evil to save the world. It was <b>me </b>relentlessly hurling my whip at zombies and rock golems. That was <b>me</b> who got goosebumps when I first saw the skeleton of a fallen predecessor impaled on a spike wall.</p>\n<p>You have likely already trained to be the hero. You know what it\u2019s like to imagine yourself in heroic situations. You have desires for the direction of your life, things you want to accomplish; the ways you want to help people. And in all likelihood, your disconnect from the idea of heroism has contributed to you <b>feeling unable</b> or even <b>hopeless</b> in your pursuit of your dreams. There is a way out, a way forward, and actions that you can take to kick yourself into gear. We\u2019ll get to that in a minute.</p>\n<p>But we\u2019ve covered a lot, so first let me bring things in full circle:</p>\n<p>1) All human societies have needed, shared, and honored heroes.</p>\n<p>2) There is staggering overlap between even the most different of history\u2019s hero tales.</p>\n<p>3) The reason there is overlap is because heroism transcends culture &#8211; it\u2019s innate to us being <b>human.</b></p>\n<p>4) <b>YOU ARE A HUMAN.</b> You have wanted to be heroic your entire life as part of your nature.</p>\n<p>5) Video games, more than almost anything, nurture that desire.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>What then? What\u2019s next?</p>\n<p><b>SEEING LIFE AS A VIDEO GAME</b></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the good stuff, ladies and gentlemen. This is why you\u2019re here. I mean, come on, this is Yu-Kai Chou\u2019s blog, right? Where are the breakdowns, the action steps?!</p>\n<p><b>First</b>, I\u2019ll give you the roadmap &#8211; the route you will take to get to your Level 50, as well as some tips for how to get there efficiently.</p>\n<p><b>Then</b>, I\u2019ll break this self-applied Hero\u2019s Journey down via the excellent Octalysis tool &#8211; after all, it makes nothing but sense that something so innate to our humanity would affect change in a lot of Core Drives, no?</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get into it.</p>\n<p><b>THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u201dIt&#8217;s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don&#8217;t keep your feet, there&#8217;s no knowing where you might be swept off to.\u201d &#8211; Gandalf the Grey<strong>\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p>Here we are, finally having arrived at the step-by-step walkthrough of The Hero\u2019s Journey. It\u2019s a doozy, so you\u2019d better take a minute to get prepared. Here\u2019s what I want you to do: Pick your favorite work of epic fiction (Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, The Hunger Games, what have you.) and try to imagine the events that coincide with that story as we go through. Imagine the hero, the mentor, the goal, and the trials that arise as the character moves forward. Ready? Here are the steps:<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><b>1) The Ordinary World</b></p>\n<p>The Hero\u2019s starting point &#8211; ordinary, pre-adventure life. Can be good or bad &#8211; In the Lord of the Rings, Frodo\u2019s life is good. In The Hunger Games, Katniss\u2019 life is terrible.</p>\n<p><b>2) The Call To Adventure</b></p>\n<p>The Hero is introduced to a larger world to be a part of &#8211; and is beckoned to it.</p>\n<p><b>3a) Refusal of the Call</b></p>\n<p>In a moment of fear or doubt, the Hero runs away from their calling.</p>\n<p><b>3b) Meeting with the Mentor</b></p>\n<p>This can be either the first time the character meets their mentor, or the moment when the Mentor encourages the Hero to take on the Quest.</p>\n<p><b>4) Crossing the Threshold</b></p>\n<p>The Hero takes his first steps out of the Ordinary World and into the Special World.</p>\n<p><b>5) Tests, Allies, and Enemies</b></p>\n<p>The Hero begins to face tests, involving allies and enemies to test their mettle and resolve &#8211; heroism is proven through difficulty.</p>\n<p><b>6) Approach</b></p>\n<p>Internal and external preparation &#8211; the moment at which the Hero sees their destination in sight.</p>\n<p><b>7) Ordeal</b></p>\n<p>The ultimate, central conflict. The big boss fight, where the stakes are highest and death lurks around every corner.</p>\n<p><b>8) Reward</b></p>\n<p>Having overcome the ordeal, there is either an intrinsic or extrinsic reward awaiting the hero and those who benefit from their actions. Sometimes this is concrete (like actual treasures), but often it\u2019s more abstract and ethereal.</p>\n<p><b>9a) The Road Back</b></p>\n<p>The Special World, with all of the lessons and trials and investment that the Hero has endured, might be more comfortable than the Ordinary World. Sometimes the return is harder than the departure. (This doesn\u2019t refer to a regression to where the hero was before, but often it\u2019s a symbolic for reconciling who the Hero was, and who they now are.</p>\n<p><b>9b) Epiphany</b></p>\n<p>All of the growth and change the Hero has undertaken comes to a head in one glorious moment of enlightenment. This is the permanent transition into the new self, with the things of the Ordinary World now a distant memory.</p>\n<p><b>10) The Return Home</b></p>\n<p>The Hero returns home having changed, and uses the gifts, the strengths, the perspective they gained to better those around them. The Road Back saw the character having difficulty reconciling the Special World with the Ordinary World, and now adjusts to life as the proven Hero.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Phew! OK, that was quite a bit to absorb. It was a near-perfect fit, wasn\u2019t it? That story you picked? Cool, huh? Tell your friends!</p>\n<p>But what have we learned? We\u2019ve learned that the Hero\u2019s Journey is a great framework for understanding stories, and that\u2019s great &#8211; but take another look. Think of an area in your life where you feel like you NEED to change and haven\u2019t done anything yet, and another area of your life where you\u2019ve overcome (or are overcoming) a challenge that will lead to growth.</p>\n<p>In the first example, what you\u2019re managing is The Ordinary World. There\u2019s nowhere to go but forward &#8211; what\u2019s your \u201dCall\u201d in this situation? What\u2019s The Special World?</p>\n<p>In the second, let\u2019s say for argument\u2019s sake that you are in the Tests, Allies, and Enemies phase. You began a fitness journey a year ago, and you\u2019ve been tested through sickness and the difficulties of building the discipline to be consistent. Your wife started going with you to aid you in your quest, but you hear from all around you the taunting of people who tell you to quit &#8211; calls of \u201dyou\u2019re doing it wrong\u201d or \u201daren\u2019t you satisfied yet?\u201d or \u201dcome hang out at the bar with us on Friday\u201d surround and torment you as your mettle is tested.</p>\n<p>Now what? What\u2019s different? We\u2019ve hopefully just learned exactly how effective a lens the Hero\u2019s Journey can be through which to view life progress, and life effectiveness. Whatever your journey looks like, you\u2019re somewhere on the path &#8211; and you have a roadmap now to move forward. Load up your bags, sharpen your sword, and get a good night\u2019s rest &#8211; you have quite a journey ahead of you!<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><b>AN 8-FACETED LOOK AT THE HERO</b></p>\n<p>And here we\u2019ve arrived at the Octalysis view of this whole process. What are the aspects of the Hero\u2019s Journey that tap into the Core Drives and propel a person forward?</p>\n<p>This is a bit of a different method of thinking, given that Octalysis is frequently used to analyze the engagement effectiveness of products or services, especially with respect to an external audience. We\u2019re here using it to look at a framework that applies to one person. It\u2019s a powerful tool, so let\u2019s have a look.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/octalysis.yukaichou.com_.2015-01-08-1-page-001-e1422465860851.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5625\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/octalysis.yukaichou.com_.2015-01-08-1-page-001-e1422465860851.jpg?resize=560%2C547&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The Hero's Journey Octalysis Analysis by Timothy Barber\" width=\"560\" height=\"547\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/octalysis.yukaichou.com_.2015-01-08-1-page-001-e1422465860851.jpg?w=560&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/octalysis.yukaichou.com_.2015-01-08-1-page-001-e1422465860851.jpg?resize=300%2C293&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>What are some characteristics of this breakdown that we\u2019re starting to notice?</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a strong balance between left/right, intrinsic/extrinsic motivators.</p>\n<p>Obtaining something elusive, and building your achievements and accomplishments is inherent to the process of personal change and growth. Extrinsic motivators abound.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the benefits of the thrill of adventure itself &#8211; the thrill of truly working toward a worthwhile change in your life &#8211; is tremendously motivating too! Coming up with creative solutions to important obstacles, while gaining mentorship and the aid of allies as you carry on the mysterious path of learning and discovery is undeniably rewarding.</p>\n<p>Another thing &#8211; this is White Hat all the way! Accomplishment? Meaning? Empowerment? Just listen to the words we use to describe these Core Drives! They reek of heroism and nobility, and improvement. This whole process is about <b>you</b>, and your personal quest for change and improvement. When you succeed, it\u2019s not just that you succeeded in building a skill. It\u2019s that you succeeded at this, and as a result <b>you</b> directly benefited from your actions. And really, I\u2019m not sure of many more successful ways to contribute to your sense of meaning.</p>\n<p>As for the Black Hat aspects &#8211; the fear of loss can be an important facet, but it\u2019s not designed in. There is something to be said for raising the stakes a bit. Science has born out the idea that we are more motivated to keep from losing something than we are to fight to gain something of equal value. It\u2019s just not built into the process near to the degree that the others are. In fact, the fear of loss or avoidance is often more a <b>demotivator </b>than a motivator to go through this process! It\u2019s hard! It takes effort, and lots of work! Some are content to stay in the ordinary world and never heed the call for fear that they\u2019ll lose the life they lead, or for fear that they will fail.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><b>Wow. </b>That was quite a *ahem* <i>journey</i> that we just went on. Thanks for sticking with me all the way to the end here!</p>\n<p>If I could give you just two more tips, they would be these:<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><b>START WITH WHY</b></p>\n<p>Frodo could never have made the trip to Mount Doom, enduring what he did, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was going to save the entire world from enslavement and misery. Meaning and Avoidance drove him in equal measure.</p>\n<p>Luke wouldn\u2019t have even taken his first step toward Alderaan if not for the fact that his journey would save lives.</p>\n<p>Harry Potter wouldn\u2019t have ever accepted the letter from Hogwarts if he had an incredible and beautiful home life to begin with &#8211; in his case he was driven away by the Avoidance and Curiosity, and by the Scarcity of the opportunity that awaited him: \u201dThis might be my only chance to find something better!\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not asking you to find a life-threatening problem and tackle it all at once. Motivation wanes and you\u2019ll tail off if you try to go too quickly. Even the best need rest.</p>\n<p>But you won\u2019t be able to stick it out unless you really, TRULY care about finding success.</p>\n<p>If you want to quit habitually drinking because you don\u2019t like the smell of bourbon-breath or your beer belly, you won\u2019t get very far before the Ordinary World is pretty attractive looking again.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you\u2019ve gotten a notice from your doctor about your declining liver health, you\u2019re losing touch with your loved ones, or you don\u2019t want to become like your father, you\u2019ll be able to dig deep and find the motivation to carry on. Get serious with yourself about why you want to change.</p>\n<p><b>A WINNING SYSTEM</b></p>\n<p>This is going to come off as strange advice, but I don\u2019t want you to focus all of your time on the goal. It won\u2019t be near as helpful as you imagine.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong &#8211; having goals is very, VERY important. It\u2019s crucial for determining your Point B and identifying your \u201cwhy\u201d. In fact, you need to be cognizant of the goal in order to get back on track toward it when you falter a little bit.</p>\n<p>But this leads you into a modus operandi of <i>thinking, without doing.</i> Taking action is what separates a hero from a coward, remember? It\u2019s a shame to do something wrong, but it\u2019s also a shame to be able to do something good and do nothing.</p>\n<p>Goal-oriented people are in a constant state of lacking, striving, and a focus on the \u201dsomeday\u201d when their goal has been achieved.</p>\n<p>The best way to achieve a goal is to break it down into a repeatable <i>system</i> and implement it with consistency to pave the road to accomplishing it.</p>\n<p>Systems are great for the \u201cdoing\u201d part &#8211; they are the course itself, what we follow on the journey toward reaching the goal.</p>\n<p>Systems-oriented people are in a state of regular, motivating achievement, of daily guided successes, of blissful productivity. In the event of a setback, a mistake, or a failure, they are able to quickly identify the failing and course-correct. Build systems and hold yourself accountable to them &#8211; make it part of your to do list to follow up and implement what you know to do.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>There &#8211; now that I\u2019ve shown you the Call to Adventure and offered a little bit of my Mentorship\u2026 are you ready to Cross the Threshold?</p>\n<p><strong>About the Author</strong>: Tim Barber is a game designer, gamification enthusiast and lifestyle designer, with companies like Google and YouTube in his resume.

I have been using their platform and they have convincingly increased my website engagement metrics in many tangible ways &#8211; to the extent that I decided to get involved with them as their Behavioral Scientist. Recently, I helped them create a video tutorial series that is now branded as the <a href=\"http://academy.captainup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Captain Up Gamification Academy</a>.</p>\n<p>While every platform has limitations &#8211; and in the past few months they have been focusing on making their product more ubiquitous by making implementation seamless on platforms like WordPress, Shopify and many others \u2013 there are still many ways to incorporate the 8 Core Drives into the experience.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s review the different ways to accomplish this:</p>\n<h3>Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</h3>\n<p>Core Drive 1 is mostly implemented by having a \u201ctheme\u201d within the Captain Up program. Since you can customize all the levels and badges (even upload your own customized images), as well as the language you use on each interface.</p>\n<p>If you have a <a href=\"http://couponroller.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gamified coupon site with a money saving-theme</a> targeting stay-home wives, you could use the theme of being a \u201cFamily Hero.\u201d All the levels and badges could be in the form of \u201cpenny saver,\u201d \u201ctreasure hunter,\u201d \u201cbacon maximize\u201d and get users to feel that every action they take on the site helps them save money and contribute tangibly to the family while having fun.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment</h3>\n<p>This is the easiest to implement with a platform like Captain Up. As long as the users consistently feels a sense of progress, and whenever they hit certain milestones they actually feel accomplished, you have accomplished your Core Drive 2 Objectives.</p>\n<p>When you design your points in Captain Up, make sure that points are given from meaningful activities. Those should accumulate into meaningful achievement symbols \u2013 badges that are obtained not from blatant activities but ones that users actually can feel proud of. Also, beginning levels should be easy to level up to, but it gets proportionally harder as time goes by.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback</h3>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>As usual, Core Drive 3 is the most difficult Core Drive to implement well, but also the most rewarding if done successfully. Usually, this means you need to give users multiple ways to reach the win-state, allowing them to play by their unique expression and creativity.</p>\n<p>If users should reach a high level by doing the highest variety of actions, or because they have done one action persistently for two weeks, allowing users to strategize and optimize often creates the best type of play.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive 4: Ownership &amp; Possession</h3>\n<p>One of the most common Game Techniques of Core Drive 4 is Collection Sets. Since you already have a theme declared with Core Drive 1, you can now create various type of themed collections within your site. For instance, my site is all about the 8 Core Drives, so one of the things I can do is to allow users to collection a set of 8 Core Drive badges by spending enough time in my various blog posts and videos that talk about each Core Drive.</p>\n<p>This way users not only are effectively collecting a themed badge set, they are also feeling strong Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment towards their Win-State.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive 5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness</h3>\n<p>There are generally two types of social interactions that can be designed within a site: social interaction between users and the website manager, and social interactions between the users.</p>\n<p>Captain Up effectively allows websites to do both. By having a refreshing leaderboard, people can see who are the active participants and eventually develop more connectedness between them. If your site has a commenting session, users will start to see the common names appearing and be more prone to respond to them. It would be better to only show the names of the users on the leaderboard but not their score, however, UNLESS these users are within reach of the viewing user (so oftentimes, only 5 above and 5 below the user).</p>\n<p>Captain Up also allows the site manager to reach out to their users. There is a custom system where the site manager can select a list of users by multiple sorting dimensions and send out custom messages to them. This can show great appreciation and feedback mechanics to the user, making the experience more rewarding.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive 6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience</h3>\n<p>Scarcity exists only when the user knows an obtainable exists. If the user does not know it exists, there is no motivation. If it is not obtainable in the user\u2019s perception, there is also no motivation. Captain Up\u2019s platform constantly shows what badges and levels are yet to be obtained by the users, as well as a progress bar to show how close the user is to the goal.</p>\n<p>I personally like to make the exact Desired Actions a secret with little clues for the users to figure out, instead of blatantly telling them what to do. In that sense, people have to take educated guesses and see what moves the progress bar forward.</p>\n<p>Some badges are also extremely difficult to obtain \u2013 to the point that only a handful of people should earn it. There are badges on my site that is \u201cmeet these requires on the site WITHIN 7 days.\u201d This means that if the user is not persistently doing something in a short burst, they lose all their progress. Generally, you should never let the user feel like everything is done. There is always another level or another badge that still needs to be obtained.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive 7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity</h3>\n<p>Core Drive 7 is one of the unique things that Captain Up does especially well. One of the fun ways to incorporate Core Drive 7 is as mentioned above: instead of telling people exactly what they need to do to earn the badge, you give them little clues for them to guess.</p>\n<p>On my site, there is a badge called Icarus, who is the person in Greek mythology that flew too close to the sun and got burnt. By doing some research about this character, the user might get the clue of clicking on the yellow sun on the top right of my site.</p>\n<p>In addition, there are Easter Egg-like features on the site. One great example is on the footer of this website. On my city-themed blog design, the footer is the base and entrance of a building. If a user clicks on the door of the building, however, the whole website would change from daytime to night time, with a different set of navigation items. Users will also unlock an unexpected badge called &#8220;Portal.&#8221; This allows those curious enough to explore around to discover new and deeper content on my site.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance</h3>\n<p>One of the two important dynamics within Core Drive 8 is the Sunk Cost Prison and the FOMO Punch. The FOMO Punch reminds users what they would be losing out if they did not participate in the experience, which is great in the Discovery Phase of a user&#8217;s experience. This can be communicated through the pop-up that invites users to join the system.</p>\n<p>The Sunk Cost Prison reminds users what they would be losing if they left the system. If the site is often reminding users of their achievements and collectables, they would feel a bit more hesitant to abandon the site and never come back. Of course, there still needs to be more booster designs within the system for this to work.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Like any gamification platform, simply having the technology is not enough to create an engaging experience. You need to understand how to incorporate good design via the 8 Core Drives into the experience to create long lasting fun and engagement. Captain Up enables any website owner to add gamification to their website easily, but whether users will come back and achieve glory is up to the experience designer.</p>\n",

Check out the <a title=\"Gamification Framework\" href=\"http://www.octalysis.com\" target=\"_blank\">Octalysis Framework</a> that I am internationally kn</em>own for.)</p>\n<h3>Gamify Your Life &#8211; Up For the Challenge?</h3>\n<p>The last year\u00a0seems to have gone by pretty quickly. But now we have a fresh new start at a brand new year. Most people are inspired to set some type of New Year\u2019s resolution. If you\u2019ve been following our blog posts, you are probably quite familiar with the Core Drives of game players that make up the Octalysis framework.</p>\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These drives specify the chief sources of motivation that games should ideally cater to in order to be thoroughly immersive, fun and engaging. When used in a balanced fashion, these factors \u00a0motivate individuals to keeping playing and overcome setbacks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, think about what it would be like to experience this type of momentum with your own personal development goals. Although most people have the best of intentions when setting their New Year\u2019s resolution. However, it is a normal tendency for individuals to quit their New Year\u2019s resolution within a few days, weeks or months.\u00a0 But what if you not only \u00a0learn the lessons of what it takes to create truly fun experiences but also apply these principles to your very own life?\u00a0 You might actually be one of the rare individuals persist with their resolutions to the end December, ready to successfully tackle an entirely new resolution for the next year! You will be the New Year\u2019s resolution master!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My passion as a gamification consultant extends beyond best practices and principles in game design. Ultimately, I want to see this world become a more fun place. Imagine what it would be like to be so engaged with life, including work and school. We would get through the things we \u201chave to do.\u201d with less resistance and a greater sense of fulfillment and meaning. We would also be motivated to create new, exciting and beneficial solutions instead of just getting by through the \u201cdaily grind.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Life is too short for most of our waking hours to be spent experiencing the feelings of drudgery and utter boredom.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I firmly believe that if we can empower ourselves to actually create more opportunities \u00a0for fun. And games can be one of our best teachers for doing this. Rather than depending heavily upon them as a source of enjoyment, we can choose to reframe our perspective and learn important lessons for creating our own sense of fun. Think of how powerful it would be to actually harness \u00a0your inner resources and transform life\u2019s seemingly mundane situations into truly engaging quests and challenges? We wouldn\u2019t have to feel so bogged down by feelings of resistance, frustration and aversion which sabotage our ability to truly enjoy our lives.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Imagine what it would be like to realize at the deepest level of our being that we are the heroes of our own stories, not someone else\u2019s. And as we align ourselves with this perspective, we can better position ourselves to look deeper past the surface of our existence to see and create opportunities for living each and every moment to it\u2019s fullest.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Beyond learning the Octalysis Framework</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Up until now, you may have been eager to learn more about Octalysis and how it can be applied to design better games. But in light of this upcoming new year, \u00a0I want you to consider a new challenge of using this framework within the context of your own life. Whether you are interested in advancing your career, succeeding at your own business, becoming more fit, saving money, improving your personal relationships, learning developing greater confidence or cultivating a new hobby, all these endeavors will require consistent action and dedication. And if game principles can motivate effortless perseverance, why not apply these concepts to everyday situations where you can benefit from this mindset?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most people consider their New Year\u2019s resolution over and done with as soon as they make a mistake or miss one day of not doing what they are supposed to. But this is where I\u2019d like you to redefine what it means to keep a resolution. If you falter with your consistency, just forgive yourself get back on track and don\u2019t quit. The rewards in the end will be worth it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now keep in mind that the eight Core Drives of Octalysis specify human motives within a game context. And if you are to see your life as an adventurous game, it would be valuable to see how this framework can apply to personal progress and development. Therefore, Octalysis can be a helpful reference to re-imagine the achievement of your goals and keep you motivated as you would with your favorite game.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning and Calling</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c<em>If you aim for nothing, you will hit it every time\u201d- Zig Ziglar</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think of your life as being your playing field. Without an ultimate inspiring vision for your grand purpose or smaller goals, it can seem like you are just going through the motions of what you are supposed to be doing. Your daily actions are just reduced to completing a bunch of tasks simply to get by and stay clear of problems.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your Epic Meaning and Calling starts with a meaningful vision. As the hero of your life\u2019s journey, you are strong enough, capable enough, smart enough and creative enough to rise above circumstances you are not happy with and create new ones. Sure there are challenges and obstacles. But you can use your inner resources to overcome them. Being rooted in a strong sense of purpose and meaning can help you see things in a whole new light and fuel the motivation that you need.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have not thought about defining your Epic Meaning and Calling, here are some questions to think about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What do you feel deep down is your life\u2019s purpose?</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What principles do you stand by?</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What would you ideally like to do to make a positive impact in this world?</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What are you uniquely good at?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you simply want to lose weight and become more fit or achieve a more simplistic goal for the last year, your Epic Meaning and Calling doesn\u2019t have to be some deep profound answer. It can simply be a vision of how you would enjoy the experience of reaching your goal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However you choose to define this Core Drive in your life, what\u2019s important is that it truly evokes a lasting and genuine feeling of inspiration within you.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Core Drive 2: Development and Accomplishment</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More often than not, it is the case that your grand vision will require that you achieve smaller steps, reach certain milestones and master a set of skills along the way. And of course, this will require consistency and discipline which may seem difficult, challenging or daunting. But if games can bring out these qualities in people, why not use gamification concepts to cultivate the momentum you need.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Create a written plan that specifies what actions you need to take. Go a step forward and break down these steps into clear tasks and actions that you will need to accomplish on a day to day basis. These can even include learning goals and questions that you need to find the answers to.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Choose to see your achievement strategy as fun. And remember that every task that you complete is like a stepping stone or a jigsaw puzzle piece that contributes to your overarching vision. Therefore make it a point to celebrate your small accomplishments as you achieve the items on your lists. And even if you happen to miss days or certain objectives, simply learn from these incidents, resolve to do better and keep working on your objectives.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No matter what you\u2019ve set out to accomplish, you will undoubtedly need to solve problems and come up with new and novel solutions. Using your creativity to actually create new possibilities for your own life can be exhilarating if you choose this to be the case.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the process of reframing old, seemingly boring or even adverse situations into new opportunities for growth will require creativity and outside the box thinking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you exercise your creativity to reach milestones, you may not only feel internally rewarded, but also you might garner positive feedback and recognition from others and have new doors open for you along the way.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Core Drive 4: Ownership and Possession</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Naturally, you expect to earn tangible results from your endeavors \u00a0that you can actually possess or accumulate. In real life, this commonly takes the form of financial rewards which often translates to material acquisitions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">a new car</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">a dream home</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">nice clothes</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">bigger savings</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">an overall higher standard of living</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The drive towards Ownership and Possession may also involve pursuing credentials such as a degree, diploma or certification.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also, think about how well known entertainment professionals will vie for an Oscar or a Grammy. Athletes will compete for medals at the Olympics and so forth. I\u2019m sure you get the picture.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whatever you choose for your New Year\u2019s resolution and self development, personal and professional goals, determine what tangible rewards you would like to own or possess. And think of this and other rewards to motivate you along the way to your ultimate vision.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Core Drive 5: Social Influence and Relatedness</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rather than achieving successes and wins in a silo, most people find it more gratifying to have their efforts recognized by others.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a number of different ways this can be realized. A person could decide to enter a contest or competition. If they are primarily motivated by altruistic objectives, they may choose to become very active in a charity and impact as many lives as they can. This would naturally generate a considerable amount of positive attention, not to mention appreciation from other people. Joining a Meet Up or other type of support group would be another way to connect to others while striving towards a personally cherished vision.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also with today\u2019s social media tools like Facebook, You Tube and Twitter, attaining Influence and strengthening one\u2019s relationship to others is within everyone\u2019s reach if they are dedicated to creating new content and sharing on a regular basis.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Core Drive 6: Scarcity and Impatience</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Core Drive of Scarcity and Impatience is about the motivation to pursue what you can\u2019t immediately have. For example, you may want to live an affluent, stylish lifestyle. Or you may want to own a item made by a luxury brand that is known for catering to the rich and famous.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even if you are not the type of person who is particularly motivated by materialistic pursuits, think of what you might ideally want, but is not within easy grasp at the moment. Challenge yourself to aspire towards what seems to be an unattainable dream. The experience of actually reaching what seemed to be nearly impossible will be a victory that is all the more gratifying.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Core Drive 7: Unpredictability and Curiosity</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Achieving anything worthwhile requires that you move out of your comfort zone.\u00a0 For some people, this can feel scary. But this is a matter of perception and a matter of choice. Each person can choose to look upon their new journey with a sense of adventure. It\u2019s all a matter of attitude and perception. The unpredictability of it all can be viewed through an open minded attitude of curiosity and a willingness to explore rather than through the lens of fear or aversion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And with this perspective taking unchartered steps in new directions doesn\u2019t have to feel risky, frightening. Nor does it have to feel like you are adding more tasks &amp; obligations to your busy life.\u00a0 Rather, moving beyond your comfort zone can feel like an experiment or an opportunity to expand your horizons and venture beyond familiar boundaries.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Core Drive 8: Loss and Avoidance</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When creating change in your life, it is usually best to start off with a reasonable degree of moderation. For obvious reasons, you probably would not want to spend excessive amounts of time and financial resources in trying to leap into the life and career of your dreams.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an example, if you are considering the idea of one day leaving your day job to become a successful entrepreneur, it is recommended that you have at least up to about two or three years worth of savings to support your basic living expenses. It will take some time to establish the right foundations for your business before you can reap the benefits of a desired stream of revenue. Therefore, it is best to probably stay at your job until you\u2019ve made enough to support yourself during the very initial stages of your business.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps you don\u2019t want to start your own company. But in the last year, you may decide to implement Core Drive 8 into your life to avoid loss by simply saving more and spending less. Therefore your personal challenge might involve finding new strategies for enjoying your life or getting the important things done while reducing spending.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although I\u2019ve developed my career as a gamification professional, some people might find it surprising that I don\u2019t promote the gaming culture.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, I support excellence in game design. But I regard this as secondary to what I consider my \u00a0my Epic Meaning and Calling, if you will.\u00a0 My fondest desire is to contribute to a world that \u00a0helps people \u00a0become so engaged with their real lives that they don\u2019t have time to immerse \u00a0themselves games. What a wonderful place this would be for everyone when we are finally able to appreciate our lives to the fullest extent and all the opportunities we have for creating new experiences of \u00a0enjoyment and adventure with what is already in front of us and around us!</p>\n<p>I hope all of you take these considerations to heart and have a most \u00a0fun filled and fabulous new year!</p>\n</div>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>One of the frustrations I have is that, in all my public speeches, since I can never assume the audience have previous knowledge of Octalysis, I always have to cover the fundamentals of gamification as a whole, Human-Focused Design, and the 8 Core Drives of Octalysis. As a result, I keep making similar talks over and over without being able to go in depth of unleashing the powers of the 8 Core Drives to improve peoples\u2019 designs.</p>\n<p>As a result, I started to do 3-Day (4 hours a day) online workshops with a variety of attendees from all over the world. I\u2019m thinking about doing three to four of these a year, each being in a different time of the day so other continents can find a time to comfortably attend too.</p>\n<p>We recently just finished the first European/US time zone focused 3-Day Online Workshop, and it was a tremendous success! <strong>Over 40 people took part in this great journey</strong> of learning and applying the 8 Core Drive, Octalysis Strategy Dashboard, and creating Concept Wireframes towards their own projects.</p>\n<p>A few have already written to me about how taking the workshop has changed the way they do things with a lot of results. An attendee from\u00a0South Africa even gave a very generous testimonial too:</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"float: left; margin: 5px;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-02-at-8.27.46-PM.png?resize=85%2C98&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"85\" height=\"98\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><span style=\"color: #333333;\">\u00a0&#8220;So I would like to let Yu-Kai and all of you know that one of the companies that I work for has \u00a0already been transformed thanks to the Strategy Dashboard.\u00a0</span></span></em><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">Our projects have a much better \u00a0direction, we have found new ways to monitor the projects as well as monetize them.\u00a0</span></em><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">Our designers \u00a0love it as it has helped them design more focused interfaces with direct links to the actions we want \u00a0to encourage&#8230;.t</span></em><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">he CEO is itching to get on the next course as well.\u00a0</span></em><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">So Thank you Yu-kai Chou You have truly helped me.&#8221;\u00a0</span></em></span><strong>-Ryan Julyan, Former Workshop Attendee\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Quick Summary of the\u00a0</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>Day</strong><strong>\u00a0Gamification Workshops</strong></h2>\n<p><!--more-->Gamification Workshop Day 1: Fundamentals</p>\n<p>Day\u00a01\u00a0was great as we consolidated much of the 8 Core Drives knowledge so that everyone who has learned from me in the past will have a strong foundation over the motivation design pieces within the framework.</p>\n<p>In my public talks, we merely introduce the 8 Core Drives and list out some examples. In the Day 1 Workshop we went into details about the nature of these 8 Core Drives, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to balance White Hat with Black Hat as well as Left Brain and Right Brain Core Drives.</p>\n<p><strong>It made me happy that a couple folks who finished\u00a0Day\u00a01\u00a0asked if they could do\u00a0Day\u00a02\u00a0last moment.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3>Gamification Workshop Day 2: Implementing a campaign through the Strategy Dashboard</h3>\n<p>Day\u00a02\u00a0was about putting that knowledge into action on a real design project. Even though it was a bit more similar to traditional project management and design learning materials, it is based on the\u00a0Day\u00a01\u00a0foundation and has a strong focus on creating activity loops, reward schedules, and feedback mechanics.</p>\n<p>This is important because so many people figure out how to create great ideas that motivate people when they learn about Octalysis, but fail to incorporate that into a process that outputs a fully engaging system at the end.</p>\n<p>Sometimes just using the Octalysis Strategy Dashboard to define the priority list within Business Metrics and defining the Desired Actions leading to them can really change a business around from my own experience.</p>\n<h3>Gamification Workshop Day 3: Custom Octalysis Design for Attendee Projects</h3>\n<p>To be honest, I was fairly nervous about\u00a0Day\u00a03, since it is always a little bit\u00a0unpredictable \u2013 Core Drive 7. I could prepare for\u00a0Day\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a02, but couldn&#8217;t really prepare for\u00a0Day\u00a03, as it depends on the preparation work of the attendees, questions, and specific cases they present.</p>\n<p>Either no one prepares anything, and I need to come up with things to talk about, or everyone prepares too much and I need to figure out how to make sure everyone gets (and not just the person presenting) a ton of specific case-driven value out of it.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also always the risk where I would end up being like, &#8220;Umm&#8230;.I don&#8217;t know how to solve this problem&#8221; which would make me look pretty bad, haha (although so far I am blessed to not gotten stuck like that yet). I&#8217;m also unsure if other attendees would get bored when I&#8217;m going through improvements on another person&#8217;s project. This also makes\u00a0Day\u00a03\u00a0to be the most fun for me though based on Core Drive3\u00a0principles: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback.</p>\n<p>Luckily,\u00a0Day\u00a03\u00a0turned out to be a big success (Core Drive\u00a02\u00a0accomplishment!). Everyone was engaged, I managed to answer most of the questions, and more importantly showed attendees how to apply the methodology everyone was learning in the past couple of days.</p>\n<p>For some attendees, we drilled down and refined on the fundamentals &#8211; the Strategy Dashboard; for others, we examined through the 8 Core Drives to make their campaigns more engaging; and then for a few we came up with some hyper creative ideas that at the minimum is worth exploring. We covered a multitude of projects, from banking, to medical websites, to a Hollywood movie project, education, and more.</p>\n<p>I smiled in relief when I saw an attendee mention in social media that\u00a0Day\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a02\u00a0were amazing, but\u00a0Day\u00a03\u00a0was the best.</p>\n<h3>Would you like to be part of this journey of being enlightened about how our brains work and improve Desired Behavior?</h3>\n<p>As I said, so far my plan is to run these workshops 3-4 times a year, depending on demand. If you plan to take your life and all your projects to the next level (why aren\u2019t people using my product? Why aren\u2019t my employees motivated? Why aren\u2019t my students studying? Why am I not studying?), you should seriously consider participating in the workshop \u2013 the earlier the better because every week you don&#8217;t have this knowledge is hurting your future wellbeing(I am biased in this statement, but I wholeheartedly believe in it. I use this knowledge literally on a bi-hourly basis and it has transformed my life).</p>\n<p>The next workshop that is coming up is on a weekend that is friendly for Pacific Time, Asia, and Australia.</p>\n<p>And if you read all the way up to this point, you deserve to get <strong>a special 35% discount code \u201cYukaiBlogReader\u201d</strong> that will be effective if you register soon. Do take advantage of it, especially if you have already missed the High Tier Early Bird Discounts!</p>\n<p><a title=\"Gamification Workshop\" href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/3-day-octalysis-gamification-workshop-usaustraliaasia-timezone-tickets-12507352829\" target=\"_blank\">Again, here is the link to Register for the 3-Day Gamification Workshop on Octalysis</a></p>\n",

Become\u00a0a guest author on my\u00a0blog! Please write to zen@yukaichou.com if you&#8217;re interested.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.whatsapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp</a> is the world\u2019s most popular Instant Messaging (IM) App, with 600 million users globally (as of September 2014). In addition to text messaging, users can send each other images, videos, and audio media messages as well as their location using integrated mapping features.</p>\n<p>WhatsApp is free to download and try for the first year. After that, you can extend your subscription for $0.99 per year (although some people get a \u201cfree extension\u201d).</p>\n<p>WhatsApp was recently acquired by Facebook for a whopping ~$22 Billion, so I thought it would be a good idea to apply the Octalysis Core Drives framework to WhatsApp, to understand what really makes it so engaging and so much fun!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to learn more about Yu-kai&#8217;s\u00a0Octalysis Gamification Design Framework</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/experience-phases-game/#.VFFBuYvF_Zc\" target=\"_blank\">click here to better understand the Player&#8217;s Journey </a>for the different phases of a user&#8217;s total experience with a product/service.</p>\n<p>So, here it goes \u2013</p>\n<h3><strong>Discovery Phase</strong></h3>\n<p>Here are the core drives in action during the first phase of the \u201cplayer journey\u201d, the Discovery Phase \u2013</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity (Core Drive #7) </strong>\u2013 This core drive is often seen as one of the key reasons why people want to try out a new app and WhatsApp is no different. You hear so much about WhatsApp from your friends, etc. \u2013 you just can\u2019t wait to find out \u201cfirst hand\u201d what the buzz is all about! You wonder which of your contacts you\u2019ll find on WhatsApp.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Influence &amp; Relatedness (Core Drive #5)</strong> \u2013 All your friends/relatives/colleagues have WhatsApp, it would be so socially \u201cuncool\u201d for you not to have it!! You must have it on your phone so as to be part of those cool friends/classmates/colleagues WhatsApp groups out there. And it has high ratings \u2013 so why not try it out?</li>\n<li><strong>Loss &amp; Avoidance (Core Drive #8)</strong> \u2013 Ultimately, one key reason why apps like WhatsApp are so popular, is because they allow you to do a lot of awesome instant messaging (IM) stuff for free! You can exchange an infinite number of messages, images, audio, video, location, contact info \u2013 all for free! Can you even imagine having to pay for all this stuff? Clearly, by helping you avoid all these costs, WhatsApp appeals very strongly to this particular core drive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Representing the above on the Octalysis diagram, here is what we have \u2013</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Octalysis-Analysis-diagram-of-Whats-App.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5383 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Octalysis-Analysis-diagram-of-Whats-App.png?resize=600%2C337&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mayur Kapur's Octalysis Analysis diagram of WhatsApp\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Octalysis-Analysis-diagram-of-Whats-App.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Octalysis-Analysis-diagram-of-Whats-App.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>Onboarding Phase </strong></p>\n<p>Welcome to the onboarding phase. A lot of core-drive-stuff going on here! Check it out \u2013</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ownership &amp; Possession (Core Drive #4)</strong> \u2013 First thing you\u2019re asked to do after installing WhatsApp, is to select your own unique \u201cprofile name\u201d and (optionally) upload one of your nice pics. This basically appeals to the core drive on Ownership &amp; Possession, since you start feeling attached to this thing which is YOUR VERY OWN profile, and you want to make it good, make it better.</li>\n<li><strong>Development &amp; Accomplishment (Core Drive #2)</strong> \u2013 A welcome message screen pops up which basically \u201ctrains\u201d you to click a button on the top-right hand side of <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-chat-box.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5385\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-chat-box.png?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WhatsApp chat box\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>your screen, and presto \u2013 you get instant \u201cfeedback\u201d in the form of a neat list of all your contacts who\u2019re already on WhatsApp! Nice!!\u00a0You send out your first message, and probably receive an instant reply from the other end \u2013 you\u2019re starting to like this already!! And why not \u2013 because all these small things make you feel \u201caccomplished\u201d, which is basically Core Drive #2.<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-Scarcity-and-Impatience.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-5386 alignright\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-Scarcity-and-Impatience.png?resize=150%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WhatsApp Scarcity and Impatience\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></li>\n<li><strong>Scarcity &amp; Impatience (Core Drive #6)</strong> \u2013 You see this screen which tells you there are (only) 12 months of free service remaining (post which\u00a0you\u00a0will need to shell out a dollar to renew the service). And that probably makes you think \u2013 well okay, gotta take full advantage of this while it\u2019s free!</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Epic Meaning &amp; Calling (Core Drive #1)</strong> \u2013 Okay, so most people use WhatsApp for staying in touch with friends/colleagues or even for stalking, but besides that there\u2019s really no strong \u201ccalling\u201d that is getting satisfied by using WhatsApp. No one\u2019s really changing the world here or making it a better place to live in. Therefore, \u201cEpic Meaning &amp; Calling\u201d is a very weak core drive for WhatsApp.</li>\n<li><strong>Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity (Core Drive #7)</strong> \u2013 You\u2019re sending a message and you\u2019re \u201ccurious\u201d if the person at the other side will respond immediately.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Adding all this information to the Octalysis diagram, we get this \u2013</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Onboarding-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5388\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Onboarding-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?resize=600%2C337&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mayur Kapur's Onboarding Octalysis Analysis Diagram of WhatsApp\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Onboarding-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Onboarding-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Scaffolding Phase</strong></h3>\n<p>On to the third phase in the player journey \u2013 Scaffolding. Here are the core drives active in this phase \u2013</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback (Core Drive #3) </strong>\u2013 By now, you\u2019re really starting to get addicted to WhatsApp. You realize you can instantly post/share anything, anytime, anywhere, with anyone (including mass messages/broadcasts). <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-Emoticons.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5389\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-Emoticons-300x141.png?resize=300%2C141&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WhatsApp Emoticons\" width=\"300\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-Emoticons.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-Emoticons.png?w=486&amp;ssl=1 486w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>Time to get creative with your messages! Of course, there are a whole lot of interesting emoticons to choose from as well.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You\u2019re online 24/7 on WhatsApp \u2013 no need to login again and again! And you keep getting real-time instant \u201cfeedback\u201d about your messages\u2019 delivery status (double-tick mark with timestamps).\u00a0<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatApp-Timestamp.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5390\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatApp-Timestamp.png?resize=248%2C44&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WhatApp Timestamp\" width=\"248\" height=\"44\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Social Influence &amp; Relatedness (Core Drive #5)</strong> \u2013 Over a period of time, as you join and participate in more and more WhatsApp Groups, there is that feeling of \u201crelatedness\u201d which makes you feel like you\u2019re part of a larger group, a larger community, which in turn motivates you to participate even more and be more active. You also start feeling the need to \u201cgive back\u201d by posting/replying more often to group messages and immediately responding to your friends\u2019 IMs (\u201cThank You economy\u201d).</li>\n<li><strong>Scarcity &amp; Impatience (Core Drive #6)</strong> \u2013 Okay, so you\u2019ve sent out that message to your friend at 9PM and she still hasn\u2019t responded. What\u2019s taking her so long to respond?? This is your \u201cimpatience\u201d core drive at play. Then there\u2019s also the fact that you cannot have more than 50 people in a WhatsApp Group \u2013 this is another form of the \u201cScarcity &amp; Impatience\u201d core drive.</li>\n<li><strong>Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity (Core Drive #7)</strong> \u2013 With IM apps, there\u2019s always a small element of Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity: my phone just beeped \u2013 who\u2019s sent me a message? What will it be about? Also, one cannot \u201cpredict\u201d the content of a message unless one actually opens and reads it.</li>\n<li><strong>Ownership &amp; Possession (Core Drive #4)</strong> \u2013 Another weak core drive, but probably you\u2019ve gotten into the habit of updating your \u201cstatus\u201d on WhatsApp, which makes you \u201cown\u201d your profile/status even more?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Time to update our Octalysis diagram again \u2013</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Scaffolding-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5391\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Scaffolding-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?resize=600%2C337&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mayur Kapur's Scaffolding Octalysis Analysis Diagram of WhatsApp\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Scaffolding-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Scaffolding-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Endgame Phase</strong></h3>\n<p>Okay, so you\u2019re a WhatsApp veteran now. What keeps you hooked/engaged to actively keep using the App even today?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Loss &amp; Avoidance (Core Drive #8)</strong> \u2013 Admit it, now that you\u2019re part of all those \u201ccustomized\u201d WhatsApp groups, and addicted to all the free IM on WhatsApp, it\u2019s pretty hard to \u201clet go\u201d. You definitely want to avoid losing contact with friends/Groups who are exclusively on WhatsApp.</li>\n<li><strong>Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity (Core Drive #7)</strong> \u2013 Towards the end of the \u201cfree usage\u201d period (usually 12 months), some WhatsApp users suddenly get a message saying they\u2019ve got a \u201cfree extension\u201d for a few more months or for a year. Sometimes you might just feel curious if you will be among the lucky ones who will get a free extension as well. <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-Free-Extension.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5392\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WhatsApp-Free-Extension.png?resize=233%2C103&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WhatsApp Free Extension\" width=\"233\" height=\"103\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>But that\u2019s unpredictable. \u201cUnpredictability &amp; Curiosity\u201d at play \u2013 though this is obviously a relatively weak core drive here.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is the updated Octalysis diagram after incorporating the points above \u2013</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Endgame-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5393\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Endgame-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?resize=600%2C337&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mayur Kapur's Endgame Octalysis Analysis Diagram of WhatsApp\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Endgame-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Endgame-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-of-WhatsApp.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>WhatsApp Octalysis Score and Summary of Analysis\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>After assessing the relative strengths of the 8 core drives (as described above), I came up with the following scores for the same \u2013</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-WhatsApp-Octalysis-Score.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5395\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-WhatsApp-Octalysis-Score.png?resize=600%2C237&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mayur Kapur's WhatsApp Octalysis Score\" width=\"600\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-WhatsApp-Octalysis-Score.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-WhatsApp-Octalysis-Score.png?resize=300%2C119&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>This gives us a total Octalysis Score of 227 for WhatsApp. Plotting these scores on the Octalysis diagram, here is what we have \u2013</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Complete-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-Score-of-WhatsApp.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5394\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Complete-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-Score-of-WhatsApp.png?resize=600%2C337&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mayur Kapur's Complete Octalysis Analysis Diagram Score of WhatsApp\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Complete-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-Score-of-WhatsApp.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mayur-Kapurs-Complete-Octalysis-Analysis-Diagram-Score-of-WhatsApp.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thus, in summary, our analysis reveals the following \u2013</p>\n<ol>\n<li>WhatsApp has an interesting Octalysis chart which shows that it primarily employs <strong>right-brain, black-hat gamification</strong> core drives</li>\n<li>WhatsApp is generally installed by people primarily to avoid paying money for Instant Messaging (\u201cLoss &amp; Avoidance\u201d), and to keep in touch with their friends/groups (\u201cSocial Influence and Relatedness\u201d). Thus, it is strong in these 2 core drives</li>\n<li>As is often the case with several Instant Messaging (IM) applications, people can use their creativity in creating/replying to individual/group chat messages in humorous/funny ways (\u201cEmpowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback\u201d), and are waiting for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next\u201d (\u201cUnpredictability &amp; Curiosity\u201d). Thus, scores for these 2 core drives are also reasonable/satisfactory</li>\n<li>WhatsApp has relatively weak scores in \u201cEpic Meaning &amp; Calling\u201d, \u201cDevelopment &amp; Accomplishment\u201d, \u201cOwnership &amp; Possession\u201d and \u201cImpatience &amp; Scarcity\u201d. However, <strong>one must keep in mind that WhatsApp is basically meant to be a no-nonsense IM service. </strong></li>\n<li>Therefore, the next section talks about some ideas for improvement in the above 4 weak core drives, while trying not to fiddle too much with WhatsApp\u2019s core value-proposition (no-nonsense IM service).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Ideas for Improving WhatsApp</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>WhatsApp is about <strong>\u201cNo Ads and No Gimmicks\u201d</strong>, so it should stress this more, maybe as a quick \u201cnarrative\u201d in its launch screen, where it can show \u201cAds\u201d and \u201cGimmicks\u201d as ugly creatures being attacked by WhatsApp. This could improve its score on \u201cEpic Meaning &amp; Calling\u201d.</li>\n<li>WhatsApp could give users the option of long-tapping on a message and <strong>\u201cfavoriting\u201d</strong> The sender of the message could see that his message just got favorited. This would improve \u201cDevelopment &amp; Accomplishment\u201d for the sender of the message and \u201cOwnership &amp; Possession\u201d (MY Favorite Messages) for the receiver. Also, all favorite messages could be retrieved later via a single-click feature</li>\n<li>WhatsApp could also give users the ability to <strong>\u201cpin\u201d some messages</strong> on top of a group-chat screen, e.g. \u2013 a funny Group-Chat Status, or the Date/Time and Venue information of a party that the WhatsApp group members are planning, so that everyone can see it easily and immediately. This would increase \u201cEmpowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback\u201d (how to creatively write this \u201cpinned message\u201d [or how to change the one that has been posted] so that it invites maximum \u201clikes\u201d/laughs/appreciation/feedback from other group members) as well as \u201cOwnership and Possession\u201d for the group members (This is <strong>MY</strong> group\u2019s unique status-message/event-message connecting/describing MY group)</li>\n<li>The <strong>\u201cMy Account\u201d </strong>page could be re-designed and made <strong>more informative and interactive to show users some interesting statistics</strong>, e.g. \u2013 how many contacts do they have in WhatsApp, who are their most \u201cactive\u201d contacts, how many messages have been sent/received till date/this month/this week (compared with last month/last week), etc. As these stats would be unique for each and every user, they would increase \u201cOwnership &amp; Possession\u201d.

All this could improve \u201cOwnership &amp; Possession\u201d and \u201cEmpowerment of Creativity and Feedback\u201d scores.</li>\n<li>WhatsApp could add 2 small <strong>ticking \u201ctimers\u201d </strong>on top of the home screen showing how many minutes/seconds have elapsed since the last message was sent and since the last message was received.

The effort did a tremendous job with Discovery and Onboarding, but in my opinion, it needed some serious work on Scaffolding and End-game dynamics. Stick around and see if you agree with me.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The analysis has remained mainly intact, only improved from the insights I got from Yu-kai\u2019s review on it. Funny story, when I submitted it, I happened to be in the monthly top 10 on Yu-kai\u2019s website leaderboard and I earned a review! Free Lunch mechanic! Whoohoo!</p>\n<p>Now, to the analysis. I kept Yu-kai\u2019s guidelines for the submission so it is easy to follow.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Pick any product or gamified system in the market that you think does a very good job on engagement (ideally its successful, and you know about it already).</b></li>\n<li><b></b><b>Provide a brief intro of what it is.

Business Metrics -&gt; Game Objective</strong></p>\n<p>a) Eliminate shortage in Singapore\u2019s blood banks</p>\n<p>b) Get X amount of shares from the campaign website</p>\n<p>c) Get X amount of App downloads &amp; Sign Up</p>\n<p>d) Raise X% the amount of Blood Donations</p>\n<p>e) Get X amount of user shares from within the App</p>\n<p>f) Get X amount of users inviting other users to the App</p>\n<p><strong>2. Users -&gt; Players</strong></p>\n<p>Their users are young people, from 18-25 years old who own a smartphone and live in Singapore. They are part of the generation Y, they are digital natives, and pursue meaning and constant feedback behind all they invest time in:</p>\n<p>Regular donors: The narrowest segment; these people go to blood centers to donate without significant external motivation. They donate because there is an epic calling when they hear about a shortage of blood, and there is purpose and gratification in knowing that they are acting upon it and saving lives.</p>\n<p>Occasional donors: These donors are not active and don\u2019t seek centers, they only donate in face of someone asking them to do so, like in a blood mobile scenario. They do it because of peer pressure, don\u2019t like saying \u201cno\u201d in front of friends, secretly wishing they were not asked in the first place. For them the experience isn\u2019t rewarding enough, there is a lot of effort asked and no sign of the benefit their donations caused, just the reward of looking good in the eyes of his/her friends.</p>\n<p>Non-donors: These people don\u2019t donate blood because of the anti-core drives. When they ask unconsciously \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for me\u201d, there isn\u2019t any answer coming from any of the core drives. The effort is perceived as bigger than the perceived outcome or reward. They will refuse peer pressure and will do anything not to donate.\u00a0This is not because they are selfish, but because donating gets automatically pushed to the side when there isn\u2019t a lot of emergent perceived value to it. No Epic meaning (They don\u2019t get to see who their blood is helping), no Accomplishment (They don\u2019t receive a card that counts your donations towards a prize), no Empowerment (There are no meaningful choices), no Ownership (Although time is invested in it, they won\u2019t ever see or monitor the donation) no Curiosity (Pretty straight forward and dull process of blood collecting), no Social influence (Maybe a \u201cthank you\u201d by the center rep.), no Scarcity (There isn\u2019t any encouragement for instant action) nor Avoidance (There is no external regulation and of course, some of them might be afraid of needles).</p>\n<p><strong>3.

The word \u201chero\u201d has somewhat of a universal connotation to be someone really looked up to. So people naturally want to be in that role, they like to have opportunities to be recognized as a hero, and even more when the required action is within their reach and ability (CD2 as well for they believe they can accomplish it).</p>\n<address><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZBF1ibUltdc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure 1 Campaign website<a href=\"http://connect.redcross.sg/\"> http://connect.redcross.sg/</a></address>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong>\u201cOne blood donation helps save 3 lives\u201d: Here you have a clear instruction on how you\u2019ll save lives.

It\u2019s an epic calling- a tiny bit of effort can change the situation. This also brings in Core Drive #5, as there is social relatedness when involving a local problem that asks for the help of the community. Also Core Drive #4 (Ownership &amp; Possession)- you naturally want to improve the city you live in.</p>\n<p>The video finishes off with \u201cthere\u2019s nothing ordinary about someone who saves lives\u201d, again enhancing the Hero theme and triggering the motivation in the potential user to kick off this movement and start sharing and participating.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Make-a-Difference-Red-Cross-Connection.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5369\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Make-a-Difference-Red-Cross-Connection.png?resize=600%2C276&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Make a Difference Red Cross Connection\" width=\"600\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Make-a-Difference-Red-Cross-Connection.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Make-a-Difference-Red-Cross-Connection.png?resize=300%2C138&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></strong></p>\n<address>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Figure 3 Campaign website<a href=\"http://connect.redcross.sg/\"> http://connect.redcross.sg/</a></address>\n<p>The real time blood meters (that you see in the above image) show the potential user what type of blood is currently being needed the most. This exposes the users to instant feedback on the urgency of the necessity and its change as the days go by. There is something about seeing real time feedback that makes this matter gain another level of trust and sense of urgency that will drive action. Especially for the ones that see that their blood type is the one needed the most.</p>\n<p>The campaign website does an exceptional job at Discovery phase, guiding the potential user to share the campaign, download the App and start his/her journey to be a life saver, share deeds and invite friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Drive #2 DEVELOPMENT &amp;\u00a0ACCOMPLISHMENT (4/10)</strong></p>\n<p>In the onboarding phase, there is an element of Core Drive #2 reinforced by their local statistics which state that with only a 1% increase in donations, they can eliminate shortages.

They are directly correlated with the action of donating (adds to history, total donations and lives saved) and the act of sharing (adds to the \u201cShares\u201d counter).</p>\n<p>The history tab does a great job in the Onboarding phase by emphasizing\u00a0Core Drive #1 again with a\u00a0call to action present: \u201cStart donating today, every donation can save three lives\u201d, and \u201cHead to your nearest blood donation center\u201d.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-Metrics-2.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5371\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-Metrics-2.png?resize=199%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Red Cross Connection User Metrics Page\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-Metrics-2.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-Metrics-2.png?w=323&amp;ssl=1 323w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>They could add another layer of player segmentation by granting them different tiers to be achieved every 10 lives saved for example, which would give them milestones to strive for and see accomplishment from another angle. Making it a victory to reach every 10 lives saved increases the feeling of Mastery and makes the users eager to see that next tier title by their name. This is also tied to Core Drive #4, Ownership and Possession.</p>\n<p>Because this is supposed to be a long-term participation to keep the blood shortage down, the app needs to have more goals for users to strive for and more ways to develop and accomplish, having the simple text \u201csave 6 more lives to be in Tier X\u201d will act like a progress bar and will drive users to want to achieve it faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Drive #3 Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback (0/10)</strong></p>\n<p>This Core Drive is not touched by this app, it does lack Mid and End-game techniques to keep it interesting.</p>\n<p>A couple of ways to take advantage of this Core Drive might be:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-Blood-Tracker.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5372\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-Blood-Tracker.png?resize=201%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Red Cross Connection Blood Tracker\" width=\"201\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-Blood-Tracker.png?resize=201%2C300&amp;ssl=1 201w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-Blood-Tracker.png?w=314&amp;ssl=1 314w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>Because the theme is \u201chero\u201d, the users could be free to express themselves in an avatar that can be customized. Just like in an MMO where we choose a basic race and then tweak it until we make the most of our expression, this app could provide basic starting heroes and allow users to use the available outfit combinations for the \u201ctier\u201d they are in. Tiers, beyond being a great way to show Status in the network, are a form of granting Access, things that only the invested users can enjoy.</p>\n<p>I think this can be enhanced also by adding freedom for users to actually create and upload their own hero designs that most represent them. This will also create a lot of Core Drive #4 in which people will feel attached and invested in the campaign.</p>\n<p>The way feedback can be tied to this is having a voting system for the best hero designs in the network. This system also brings about Core Drive #5- people like to influence each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Drive \u00a0#4 Ownership and Possession (4/10)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-find-a-blood-center.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5373\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-find-a-blood-center.png?resize=199%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Red Cross Connection find a blood center\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-find-a-blood-center.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Cross-Connection-find-a-blood-center.png?w=307&amp;ssl=1 307w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>In this app you feel ownership over your profile, it\u2019s like your hero\u2019s bio. Because you want to improve your profile, you naturally want to raise the numbers of \u201clives saved\u201d, \u201ctotal donations\u201d and \u201cshares\u201d.</p>\n<p>This app does use this Core Drive also in the sense that this activity is requiring a lot of effort and labor from the participants. Donating blood is not an easy process, it requires time and patience. People have to be willing to deal with the aftermath of donations (like drinking plenty of water afterwards for a couple of days while the blood level normalizes). So after giving all this labor to the app, the user has got to feel very invested in it.</p>\n<p>There could be more ownership generated by the avatar customization like mentioned earlier, with all the virtual goods that players can unlock as they move up in the tiers.</p>\n<p>Also, every hero has an epic name, this should be encouraged in the profile creation, this would enhance the \u201chero\u201d theme and people would also develop attachment over it.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Drive #5 Social Influence &amp; Relatedness (4/10)</strong></p>\n<p>There is relatedness right in the discovery and onboarding phase, the app is local to Singapore citizens.</p>\n<p>The only type of social influence is the sharing and inviting friends. I\u2019d suggest having more statistics like \u201cHow many donations were made through this campaign so far\u201d, \u201chow many donations were made this month\u201d as they will get the user feeling proud of being part of it.</p>\n<p>There is no leaderboard in the app, which could help with monitoring the performance in the network as well. Seeing who the donors are directly ahead of you and directly behind you will keep people accountable and help make sure they up with their donations. It helps with feeling how \u201calive\u201d this campaign is and encourages people to participate.</p>\n<p>There isn\u2019t any activity monitoring like a live feed in the app, so it does feel like a lonely experience. The notifications displayed in the activity feed would be something like \u201cHero X just earned a medal for donating in all 3 centers\u201d or \u201cHero Y just donated for center X, his 1st donation\u201d or \u201cHero W just completed his 10th donation\u201d. This will create the wish to be recognized also.</p>\n<p>To respond to the feed, users could send a \u201cPat in the back\u201d, the minimum amount of social interaction. This would make the network of donors more connected.</p>\n<p>This campaign is targeted to young users, who like to do things in groups and be among friends. There could be a badge for \u201cthe advocates\u201d, people who get their friends to sign up and make their first donation. Another badge idea is one for taking a group to the center to donate. This will add to the pool of things to be accomplished and also increase the social aspect of the campaign, making users feel related\u00a0to each other in the sharing of the experience. Also, \u201cthe advocate\u201d badge, like mentioned earlier, can get people strategizing and being creative on how to get more people to become donors for the app, so that they can get the badge (Core Drive #2 and #4).</p>\n<p>Groups that donate together could form their \u201cLeague of Heroes\u201d guild, doing things together is always more fun and adds to the relatedness.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Drive #6 Scarcity and Impatience (0/10)</strong></p>\n<p>This CD is not touched by this app. If such an avatar customization feature like mentioned were added, maybe the user could see a very nice piece of clothing for his/her hero but that is only available for a higher tier user. That would make them a little impatient and in a situation where they can\u2019t wait to get to that tier.</p>\n<p>There could also be a mechanic like, for example, January is the official blood donor month, so the first 100 users that donate in this month will receive special virtual clothing themed for the particular year. This would encourage users to donate early in every January, because that cool piece of clothing is scarce. This also makes users feel Core Drive #8 and try to avoid losing this opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Drive #7 Curiosity and Unpredictability (2/10)</strong></p>\n<p>The unpredictability drive is not used in the campaign. But this app could take this to the next level by adding in a variable of luck. Every time you scan a code from your donation, you have a chance to receive a virtual \u201cLucky token\u201d. Then two times a year, there will be a raffle to win a shirt with your customized hero printed on it, the more \u201clucky tokens\u201d you have, the more chance to win. Introducing then a random kind of reward as well as a lottery type of reward. The collection aspect of the lucky tokens will also bring Core Drive #4.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Drive #8 Loss &amp; Avoidance (2/10)</strong></p>\n<p>Loss and avoidance can definitely have an impact if the user ever considers adopting another app of similar purpose and abandoning this one. That is because all the effort given to this campaign that was tracked by the metrics will not be transferable to the other app, and the user will feel a loss if he moves. He/she might choose to stay in fear of the loss of investment. (Sunk cost prison)</p>\n<p>The app doesn\u2019t imply any FOMO (Fear of missing out) where you feel like you need to take instant action or you\u2019ll lose the chance to get better or be recognized. This app can take advantage of this Core Drive by having losable badges. For example, the user earns a badge for donating once every month, but if he breaks the streak and doesn\u2019t donate for 2 months, the badge will be lost. So making those losable will get players to try to avoid that loss.</p>\n<p>There will be milestones in the streaking, like once you reach 5 once-a-month donations, the badge solidifies and is not losable anymore. But a new badge pops up counting from 5-10, and if you don\u2019t keep consistency you\u2019ll lose this new one, that will only solidify when you reach 10. And so on.</p>\n<h3><strong>My Conclusion on the Red Cross Connection app</strong></h3>\n<p>Overall, because the main business metric is to eliminate blood shortage in the banks \u2013 and it does require long-term participation \u2013 I\u2019d suggest that they spend more time designing mechanics to support Scaffolding and End-game phases to ultimately keep the users engaged and coming back.</p>\n<p>Now that I look back at this submission, I believe the Octalysis framework allows us to collect deep findings about the motivational qualities of any effort towards engagement. I highly recommend doing this exercise and sending it over to Yu-kai so we can unlock Level 2 certification! Thanks for reading and I\u2019ll look forward to your comments.</p>\n<p>Thanks Yu-kai &amp; Co for making this possible!</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p><em>This article was written by Dylan Husted, the President and Co-founder of SaveOhno. He is currently a second-year student at Babson College studying business/entrepreneurship, sustainability and computer science.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The facts about global climate change are overwhelming. We can only burn about 565 more gigatons into the atmosphere in order to live in a relatively safe environment, and at the current rate (31.6 gigatons per year), we will have burned 1,200 gigatons of carbon by 2050. That\u2019s 112% over our 565 gigaton budget (<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\">source</a>). In addition, with developing countries transitioning from \u2018developing\u2019 to \u2018developed\u2019, global energy demand is expected to rise by about 48% by 2040 (<a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/pdf/0484%282013%29.pdf\">source</a>). This means that we are on pace for a very tumultuous future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the alarming numbers the scientific community has presented, the US has taken little action on the issue. To change that, organizations like 350.org and A Better Future Project are making amazing strides with climate activism. SaveOhno aims to help them by getting more college-age students involved through gamification. With gamification, a complex global issue like climate change can be visualized, and climate activism can be virtualized and incentivized.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What is SaveOhno.org?</strong></p>\n<p>SaveOhno is a nonprofit focused on the issue of climate change, and a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/136597581/saveohnoorg\">Kickstarter campaign was launched</a> for its gamified web platform \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.saveohno.org\">SaveOhno.org</a>. The campaign is in its final week, and it will require a significant push to reach its goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/thegame.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-5543\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/thegame.png?resize=492%2C455&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"thegame\" width=\"492\" height=\"455\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2018Ohno\u2019 is a character that represents the user\u2019s great granddaughter, and she\u2019s living in a time that is seriously affected by the climate change being caused today. It\u2019s up to the user to change her fate by taking action in the real world, through SaveOhno.org. Every time a user signs a petition, goes to a protest or contacts a politician, Ohno\u2019s life improves and the user gains badges and points to create a public profile of what they\u2019ve done.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Level 1 Octalysis</strong></p>\n<p>To provide a deeper view of the gamification aspect of SaveOhno.org, Yu-Kai Chou\u2019s Octalysis framework was used.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-26-at-5.16.37-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-5540\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-26-at-5.16.37-PM.png?resize=554%2C447&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-12-26 at 5.16.37 PM\" width=\"554\" height=\"447\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In general, the SaveOhno.org Octalysis framework has a strong emphasis on meaning, accomplishment, social influence and empowerment. It also has elements of ownership and avoidance, but it lacks in curiosity and scarcity. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each category:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Epic Meaning &amp; Calling: </strong>The user is personally responsible for saving the future of Ohno, and the rest of society, from the terrors of global climate change. This creates a narrative where the user is \u2018Humanity\u2019s Hero.\u2019 In addition, the users must cocreate to collectively save each other\u2019s worlds (Ohno\u2019s situation is unique to each user).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Development &amp; Accomplishment: </strong>As the user takes action on the website, they receive PBL feedback (points, badges and leaderboards). In addition, they track progress of initiatives they\u2019ve started and supported through progress bars.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Social Influence &amp; Relatedness: </strong>The accomplishments they earn are displayed on their public profile. They can brag about these accomplishments by sharing their profile over social media sites. Users follow others and get followed by others; to create a status feed of each other\u2019s activity. If they see that their friends are very active, they will be more inclined to be active as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback: </strong>SaveOhno.org educates people on climate change, and then provides them with the ability (i.e. empowers them) to take action.

Over time, this (coupled with town improvements from user activity) creates a \u2018build from scratch\u2019 experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Loss &amp; Avoidance: </strong>Ohno\u2019s town regresses over time (progress loss).

At first, the user will be very curious to see how Ohno\u2019s life changes, but they will catch on to the pattern over time and begin to always know what\u2019s next. Even the \u2018visual grave\u2019 will likely not be a surprise, due to the linear degradation of Ohno and her town. This will be an element that will need improvement as SaveOhno moves forward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Scarcity &amp; Impatience: </strong>There aren\u2019t really any elements of scarcity in the gamification of SaveOhno.org.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>SaveOhno.org has a pretty balanced mix of left and right brain core drives, but heavily favors white hat gamification over black hat gamification. It may be worth incorporating more black hat techniques, perhaps as spontaneous motivators when user activity declines significantly due to a lack of unpredictability and scarcity (i.e. too easy).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please leave feedback in the comments, share this article, and check out the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/136597581/saveohnoorg\">SaveOhno.org Kickstarter campaign</a>!</p>\n",

Become\u00a0a guest author on my\u00a0blog! Please write to zen@yukaichou.com if you&#8217;re interested.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">When some people hear that gamification is about customizing situations and communication to how people respond, they wonder, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that manipulation?&#8221; As a game designer focused on education, this is a serious concern to me. With games getting so much negative media attention, it can be hard to tell the difference, but there is a difference, just not where you might expect.</span></p>\n<p>To see the difference, we first need to look at the similarities. In both gamification and manipulation one person, or group, customizes their behavior, based on other people&#8217;s response to achieve their goals. <a title=\"Subliminal Advertising Experiment with Derren Brown \" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i8N5SKzRtI\" target=\"_blank\">Media is often used</a>, but it&#8217;s by no means the only method. Tone, word choice and how information is presented is often adjusted to achieve goals. With that said, what&#8217;s the difference?</p>\n<p>Honestly, on the surface, there might be little difference. Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to tell when somebody is trying to manipulate us. Sometimes we can&#8217;t tell till it&#8217;s too late. This is part of why we care about the answer to &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that manipulation?&#8221; It&#8217;s important, but the surface can deceive us, so the surface won&#8217;t tell us the answer.</p>\n<h3>The Power of Choice in Gamification</h3>\n<p>Taking a deeper look at these two terms, we understand the difference: gamification applies game design outside of games to help a user achieve his/her goals, while manipulation is the attempt to control people to accomplish things. The key part is that games are about the player&#8217;s <em>choices</em>, and game design is about empowering players in their choices to experience the intended gameplay. That&#8217;s very different from manipulation&#8217;s focus on control.</p>\n<p>A great example of unintentional gamification that clearly shows the difference is an experiment that was conducted in India with a computer. The computer was made available, for free, with no supervision to the public outside a building. Children, who didn&#8217;t know English at all, started playing with it. I say &#8220;playing&#8221;, because they were just exploring what the computer was and what it could do. When the experimenter spoke with the children months later, the first thing they said was, &#8220;We need a faster processor and a better mouse.&#8221; Nobody controlled the children or forced them to learn English or figure out how to make the computer work better, like we see in classrooms. They chose to do it, and were able to because the placement of the computer empowered the children to make those choices.\u00a0 Further experiments refined the findings and inspired experiments in alternative education.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s gamification, I&#8217;d disagree with you as a game designer. There were designed rules, just not very many. There was a designed situation, despite it being\u00a0simple. The computer was designed to give feedback based on interaction, and so were the programs made available. There was a designed, open-ended experience for the participants to go through by choice. It was like an exploration-focused sandbox game.</p>\n<p>Unintentionally, Sugata Mitra, the experimenter, applied game design to a non-game situation. That is gamification, and in this case it helped children learn a new language and other complex subjects by empowering their ability to make meaningful choices. Yu-kai Chou calls this \u201cHuman-Focused Design\u201d in his post &#8220;<a title=\"What is Gamification?\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/what-is-gamification\" target=\"_blank\">What is Gamification?</a>&#8220;. By intentionally applying the lessons he learned about human behavior (Human-Focused Design)\u00a0Sugata Mitra has made amazing, positive effects in the lives of children, and plans to do the same for many more.</p>\n<p>Children are not the only ones that benefit from gamification, as companies like Ideo and Google are known for their playful and game-like work environments and practices. The more reading I do on work environments and employee productivity and creativity, the more I see game design principles being discussed and recommended. At the same time, manipulation tactics and a lack of respect seems to be a warning sign that the company, or group, is on the road to failure. Another TED Talk by <a title=\"Tim Brown on Creativity and Play\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_brown_on_creativity_and_play\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Brown on creativity and play</a> shows how gammification by any name can enhance the lives and productivity of almost anybody.</p>\n<h3>A Warning on Manipulation</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to point out that communication and design are tools, and as tools they can be used to help or to harm. The more effective the tool is, the more potential it has to change our lives. Psychology, experience design, and effective communication have all been used to empower and to control. It&#8217;s possible to use a tool either way, but it&#8217;s not good game design if it&#8217;s used to manipulate. Gamification is about empowering choices, while manipulation is about controlling choices.</p>\n<p>While gamification and manipulation are similar on the surface, they very different below the surface.\u00a0 Gamification is about empowering people to do better and make their own, informed choices, so it can be done honestly, respectfully and with integrity.

Also, be sure to check out their </i><i>Technology Conferences Calendar</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>To check out the interview in full: <iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/167455746%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-mvUhH&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Yu-Kai Chou, a thought leader in gamification and publisher of the <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\">Octalysis gamification framework</a>, gave insights into the different motivating drivers behind the wild success of mobile game Plants vs. Zombies, white hat and black hat gamification, and the essential elements for engaging users.</p>\n<p>Yu-kai\u00a0believes the reason Plants vs. Zombies 1 (PvZ1) was more successful than Plants vs. Zombies 2 (PvZ2) is that, even though the game is essentially the same but with some new \u201cstuff\u201d to make the sequel more interesting, the core experience of PvZ2 is broken. (Note, the analysis here is mostly based on the PvZ2 in 2013. In 2014, there was a large overhaul that improved some of the issues, but still far from ideal).</p>\n<p>For him, no game is guaranteed success if it misses the essence of the game (especially in the wake of a wildly successful game) and the motivation of its players to play the game. Game mechanics and other elements can be copied from a previously winning formula, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee a hit.</p>\n<p>To verify his opinions, Yu-kai\u00a0researched why casual gamers tended to play PvZ1 more than they did PvZ2. He used his own <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/#.VBlCJJSSz41\">Octalysis Gamification Framework</a> to break motivation down into a few of the eight Core Drives. Essentially, he discovered that PvZ 2 shifted from using white hat core drives to black hat core drives.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3><b>White Hat Core Drives in Plants vs Zombies 1 Lacking in Plants vs Zombies 2</b><strong>\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p><b>Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning and Calling</b></p>\n<p>In PvZ1, a gamer\u2019s doing something meaningful by saving their home. This is something that even female demographics that don&#8217;t care about fighting games can resonate to. In PvZ2, the gamer\u2019s going through pain and trouble just so Crazy Dave can re-eat a taco. When a player is in the midst of danger, sometimes it feels fairly pointless.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><b>Core Drive 2: Development and Accomplishment</b></p>\n<p>PvZ1 is very careful with flow. After one or two minutes, a user may have three or four peashooters. They\u2019re slowly but surely amassing a stockpile and building their economy. When a user gets to the end of the game, they have a full army. Ultimately, this gives gamers a feeling of harmony and accomplishment, matched with the magic of the beats in the music.</p>\n<p>In PvZ2, the user quickly gains\u00a010 or 12 plants, providing a quick boost of\u00a0early success and productivity. However, when the user gets to the end of the game, the economy proportionally slows down but the user\u2019s still trying to finish amassing their army of plants. As a result, this makes gamers feel like they\u2019re struggling to survive.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Here is an example of how the flow differs:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/jMNTVN2WtxA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><b>Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback</b></p>\n<p>PvZ1 offers a creative process with numerous ways and combinations to seek victory in the game.</p>\n<p>PvZ2 limits options. A gamer must use certain plants or else they\u2019ll die. In the first world of mummies, if the user tries the pea shooter or even double pea shooter, chances are he will lose because of the tombs. The game has to be won by using cabbage throwers and boomerangs. Certainly, when a game forces a user to play in a certain way, the elements of play, strategy, and meaningful choices are lacking, consequently making the game boring.</p>\n<p>Yu-kai\u00a0further identified the notable differences in Milestone Unlocks:</p>\n<p>When a PvZ 1 player unlocks a milestone achievement, they\u2019re rewarded with the perfect plant that solves all past problems and makes them want to try more in the future.</p>\n<p>In the older version of PvZ2, a player is forced to earn the achievement through unlocking a stage many<i>\u00a0</i>times. It\u2019s more about scarcity and dangling rewards. Plus, the user\u2019s rewarded with a random plant that\u2019s seldom what they need, adding to the slow grind of gameplay in PvZ2. In the later update, this has improved, but the plant unlockable schedule is still far from perfect for motivation.</p>\n<h3><b>The Black Hat Core Drives of Plants vs Zombies 2</b></h3>\n<p><b>Core Drive 6: Scarcity and Impatience</b><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>In the first version of PvZ2 player plays the same stage over and over again, earning keys for a far-off goal. It ultimately overwhelms a player\u2019s patience.<strong>\u00a0</strong>The second version of PvZ2 improved on that, especially with multi-world transferring, but the dangling technique is still apparent.</p>\n<p><b>Core Drive 7: Unpredictability and Curiosity</b></p>\n<p>PvZ2 is unpredictable in that it takes players into different zones, driving fascination with these \u201ccrazy\u201d elements, and making Crazy Dave&#8217;s conversation a center piece of the game (whereas in PvZ1 Crazy Dave was not as important besides playing the role of a merchant).</p>\n<h3><b>Black Hat Gamification vs. White Hat Gamification</b></h3>\n<p>In generally, even though game firms like Zynga consider their development process as \u201cdata-driven design,\u201d a lot of it is black hat gamification, or a focus on creating urgency, obsession, and addictiveness in users. Metrics for black hat gamification include monetization, addiction, retention rates, and sharing with friends.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Black hat games ultimately leave players with a not-so-good experience. So, they end up playing just an hour or two, then leave the game and never come back.</p>\n<p>Yu-kai contrasted that to white hat gamification, where developers use motivating factors in gaming to make people feel good without a sense of urgency.</p>\n<p>Chou\u2019s eight Core Drives help developers see games as more than just mechanics. Instead, game developers need to look at the users\u2019 motivation to play their games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the game make people feel accomplished?</li>\n<li>Does the game let people make meaningful choices?</li>\n<li>Is there epic meaning and calling?</li>\n<li>Is there unpredictability in the experience?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>How to Better Employ Engagement</b></h3>\n<p>Yu-kai\u00a0outlined the different factors that are essential to employing engagement:<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Meaning: </b>He\u00a0explained that many campaigns are about scarcity and fixed-action rewards that drive motivated actions. However, this is <i>not</i> long-term motivation because people don\u2019t feel good after playing such a game\u2014as opposed to white hat gamification which stresses meaning.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Development and Accomplishment: </b>Developers ought to very carefully control flow so that it begins slowly but increases in difficulty as a gamer\u2019s experience increases. Gamers don\u2019t want to feel insulted or frustrated by a hard game.<strong>\u00a0</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Meaningful Choices:</b> Give people meaningful choices where they can customize their play and environment to make the game more interesting and more fun. The multi-world hopping is a great improvement in this, which is what made the game Megaman so innovative in the early days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, <i>meaning</i> is very important as to why people engage with certain games. Unfortunately, there are many products and resources that describe what you need to do in game development and seldom explain the \u201cwhy\u201d behind it.</p>\n<p>For more information on Chou\u2019s Octalysis Gamification Framework and its 8 Core Drives, visit <a href=\"http://www.octalysis.com\">www.octalysis.com</a>, or send Yu-Kai Chou an <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/contact-gamification-expert/\">email</a> to get certified.

Essentially, such loyalty consumers are carrying a brand\u2019s loyalty program with them wherever they go.</p>\n<p>Kirk echoed Tate\u2019s thoughts, noting that his phone is less often in his pocket than it is in his hand. With such quick, direct, and consistent access, loyalty program brands that don\u2019t currently have a mobile app ought to be considering developing one soon. Kirk mentioned that he\u2019d been using mobile payments for the last year through Starbucks\u2019 mobile app. He appreciated its ease of use and the fact that he could both pay for his coffee and redeem his rewards from the same app.</p>\n<p>Tate said that \u201cGoogle Wallet is getting close to making [physical] cards obsolete,\u201d though Kirk cautions that such non-proprietary mobile apps could cause brand dilution because a company is placing their cards within a \u201cbunch of other stuff in [a consumer\u2019s] wallet.\u201d<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3><b>The Necessity of a Mobile App for Loyalty Programs</b><strong>\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>Both Tate and Kirk agree on the high need for loyalty reward brands to have their own proprietary apps, noting that mobile-friendly sites typically aren\u2019t visited and are often useless when it comes to earning and redeeming rewards on-the-go. Tate describes how such loyalty mobile apps are highly beneficial:</p>\n<p>I think mobile apps have been one of the greatest tools that brands with loyalty programs can leverage in order to help keep their program members up-to-date on what&#8217;s going on\u2014not just with their program but with the brand as well.</p>\n<p>Kirk agrees, but brings the need for a mobile app back to an essential part of every loyalty rewards program: increasing loyalty.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong>Don&#8217;t forget what this was all about in beginning\u2014tightening my relationship with your brand so that loyalty is furthered \u2026. Don&#8217;t lose the essence of your brand by adopting some technology that is more third-party and is not really reflected back on who you are and the message you want to send in the first place.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>In other words, a customer rewards program looking to create an appealing and useful mobile app needs to design it with both the brand and the customer always in mind. The end goal ought to be better engagement for increasingly more loyal customers.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>To learn more about customer rewards programs and how open currency plays a role in today\u2019s loyalty programs, listen to the entire TechnologyAdvice podcast.</p>\n<p><i>TechnologyAdvice provides expert software comparisons on gamification platforms,\u00a0<a href=\"http://technologyadvice.com/gamification/customer-loyalty-software/smart-advisor/?utm_campaign=link+building&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=tech+conferences&amp;utm_source=yukaichou.com&amp;utm_term=customer+loyalty+programs&amp;tid=events#guide\" target=\"_blank\">top\u00a0</a></i><i><a href=\"http://technologyadvice.com/gamification/customer-loyalty-software/smart-advisor/?utm_campaign=link+building&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=tech+conferences&amp;utm_source=yukaichou.com&amp;utm_term=customer+loyalty+programs&amp;tid=events#guide\" target=\"_blank\">customer loyalty solutions</a>, employee engagement tools and much more.

People have loved games for a long time. And when someone really loves a game, they dedicate hours to mastering it.</p>\n<p>In fact, as of 2011, over\u00a0<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/2011/05/if-all-of-work-were-gamified/\">5.93 million years of total time had been spent playing World of Warcraft alone</a>. When a game is that good, people spend hours at a time engaged with the platform.</p>\n<p>This is the same type of engagement companies are experiencing with their gamification systems (albeit a little less extreme than World of Warcraft). The idea of implementing gaming techniques in the workplace was originally met with heavy skepticism, and often criticism. Now, there are\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/gamification-stats-figures/#.U8lwG_ldV8E\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of case studies</a> outlining how companies large and small have used gamification to increase profits, decrease expenses, and increase competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>A recent study performed by M2 revealed that the gamification market, currently valued at around $100 million, will grow to\u00a0more than $2.8 billion by 2016. As more companies begin to realize the massive potential of gamification in the workplace, and as vendors create new and inventive ways to gamify everyday processes, the biggest movers and shakers will seek to stake their claim on what\u2019s trending in the industry.</p>\n<p>A few trends in particular have risen from the crowd as powerful and interesting changes within the gamification industry. Companies who have taken advantage of these trends have seen successful results, and other organizations are jumping on board. <!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>Increased employee engagement expansion</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of the most widely used gamification systems are designed for sales departments and other, more repetitive departments, such as call centers and customer relations. These areas lend themselves perfectly to gamification strategies. Due to the already competitive nature of sales, point systems and leaderboards are a natural fit. By adding game elements to call centers and the customer relations department, many companies have <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204294504576615371783795248?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052970204294504576615371783795248.html\" target=\"_blank\">substantially increased productivity and success rates</a>.</p>\n<p>Other departments are beginning to notice these successes, and have begun implementing systems in their area. For example, <a href=\"http://www.insideview.com/\" target=\"_blank\">InsideView</a> wanted to increase all of their employees\u2019 social media interaction with company accounts. <a href=\"http://technologyadvice.com/gamification/employee-engagement-solutions/smart-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\">Employee engagement software</a> offered a cost effective way to achieve this. By simply sending out a monthly leaderboard (with no external incentives included), they were able\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.insideview.com/2011/07/20/b2b-sales-gamification/\" target=\"_blank\">to increase the number of updates from employees by 312 percent</a>. Other facets of the enterprise that are currently experimenting with or using gamified solutions include leadership development, accounting, research and development, and more.</p>\n<address><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/151847697&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>Interview between TechnologyAdvice&#8217;s Online Events Manager, Clark Buckner and Yu-kai Chou exploring the finer details of Gamification.</address>\n<h3><strong>Gamification for recruitment and hiring</strong></h3>\n<p>Organizations are already experiencing success from gamifying the customer experience and the employee experience.</p>\n<p>Now, many companies are beginning to implement <a href=\"http://gamificationofwork.com/2014/07/gamification-makes-onboarding-effective/\" target=\"_blank\">game elements in the recruitment and hiring process</a>. This creates a win-win for your organization. Gamified skills and learning assessments provide you with a more objective and accurate measurement of a candidate\u2019s skills. At the same time, you\u2019re presenting your company as an innovative organization where employees are challenged, all while having fun.</p>\n<p>When designing gaming systems for the recruitment and hiring process, there are a few key points you should be aware of. For starters, create a game that is challenging yet attainable. You want your gamified approach to show you the potential hire\u2019s qualities. How do they respond to adversity? Will they adjust their strategy when they hit roadblocks? How quickly can they solve problems?</p>\n<p>Second, you want the game to be applicable. While solving a mathematical puzzle might be informative and entertaining in some ways, if you\u2019re trying to hire people for your sales team, your test should be related to their interpersonal skills, perseverance, and ability to quickly learn new information.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you want to create as objective of a system as possible. If an employee cheats in a company game, they are only hurting themselves and their coworkers. If an applicant thinks that doing well in a skill game could be the difference between getting hired and remaining jobless, he will probably be more inclined to do whatever it takes, potentially even cheating.</p>\n<h3><strong>Gamification and the internet of things</strong></h3>\n<p>The internet of things (IoT) is the growing collection of everyday objects with internet connectivity. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble created the \u201c<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304360704579415161522531046\" target=\"_blank\">World\u2019s First Available Interactive Electric Toothbrush</a>.\u201d This toothbrush is capable of connecting with your smartphone to keep track of how long, how often, and how well you are brushing your teeth.</p>\n<p>As more companies enter the internet of things market, gamification companies are developing solutions to partner with these devices.</p>\n<p>Building on the toothbrush example, companies are now creating software that gamifies dental care, and partnering with these systems to create more immersive challenges, with points awarded for reaching certain benchmarks, like brushing for over two minutes. This creates a litany of new opportunities for companies to interact with their customers.</p>\n<p>By creating gamified applications that connect with common IoT devices, like\u00a0<a href=\"https://secure-nikeplus.nike.com/plus/what_is_fuel/\" target=\"_blank\">Nike Fuel</a> or the emerging Google Glass, companies can connect with their clients in new and inventive ways.</p>\n<p>Gamification should no longer be the subject of skepticism. Companies have implemented gamification in their workplace, and the results speak for themselves. Like any industry, gamification is constantly adapting and changing to solve more problems. Staying on the cutting edge of these new trends in gamification\u00a0can help your organization get the most from your gamified solution.</p>\n<p><em> <strong>Author Bio:</strong>\u00a0Jesse Jacobsen is a web content writer at <a href=\"http://technologyadvice.com/\">TechnologyAdvice</a>.

It helps organizations understand the preferred thinking styles of their customers and employees in order to develop more relevant and effective products, strategies, work environments, and innovation processes.</p>\n<p>Why does this matter? Although statistical research conclusions are available, this information is often quite broad and general in scope. Therefore, it may not be enough to truly create an outcome that speaks to the specific target audience.</p>\n<p>Targeting the thinking styles and attitudes of a particular group can help develop more seamless forms of communication and ensure product development aligns with the needs and interests of a particular group of individuals.</p>\n<p>What is central to the MindTime framework is how people relate to\u00a0<em>time</em>.</p>\n<p>There are three prominent ways that individuals related to time. This shapes their thinking style:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Past Thinker:</strong> This individual relies on the careful assessment of data and past precedents before making a decision and committing to action.</li>\n<li><strong>Present Thinker:</strong> This type of thinker takes stock of their present assets in order to create strategies for achieving their goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Future Thinker:</strong> The future thinker is oriented towards new ideas and the creation of innovative possibilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How is MindTime applied?</h3>\n<p>The MindTime technology can be applied to samples of research participants. Responses to their questionnaires are analyzed to produce refined insights about the thought patterns that are most pertinent to the project being developed.</p>\n<p>Here is a survey link to test your own personal MindTime type:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.mindtimemaps.com/gps-start/\">http://www.mindtimemaps.com/gps-start/</a></p>\n<p>Archetypes based on <em>combinations </em>of different thinking styles can also be generated for more complex environments.</p>\n<h3><strong>How Does MindTime Relate to Octalysis and Gamification Design?</strong></h3>\n<p>While Octalysis focuses on the 8 core drives of game players, MindTime profiles these individuals based on their dominant thinking styles. This level of analysis can help game producers acquire more astute and personable insights about the particular players they are designing for.</p>\n<p>As an example, a game with a balanced integration of core drives may elicit different reactions from Baby Boomers than Millennials. Due to the broadness of these categories, Octalysis and Mindtime can help to generate archetypes or personas representing the preferred thinking styles of the group that the game is intended to target.</p>\n<p>The three different MindTime archetypes would\u00a0collaborate differently with different combinations of\u00a0Octalysis Core Drives. Therefore, gamification design would not only need to consider mechanics that engage and entertain these drives, but also make decisions on how to present information in ways that appeal to the three prominent thinking styles that are inherent within their audience of players.</p>\n<p>For example, decisions on establishing reaction times would need to consider the fact that past thinkers tend to process information slowly. On the other hand, future thinkers would process information rapidly. Therefore, a game may need to incorporate different time increments that create a more ideal experience for both past and future thinkers\u00a0depending on the context of a user&#8217;s progress.</p>\n<p>The design of user interfaces as well as other decisions on visual presentation can also be enhanced and relevant to the thinking styles of game players.</p>\n<p>Future thinkers may strongly resonate with a sense of Core Drive #1 (Epic Meaning &amp; Calling) towards a grander vision. Depending on the game decisions made to fulfill this drive, present and past thinkers may be completely indifferent towards this drive, until perhaps the end of the game after they have successfully fulfilled their mission.</p>\n<p>Coming up with challenges where players can earn a strong sense of Core Drive 2 (Development &amp; Accomplishment) or Core Drive 3 (Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback), can benefit from an understanding of the thinking processes of players. Certain strategies to target these drives may be gratifying to the present and future thinkers but at the same time they may be frustrating for the past thinkers who take longer to analyze information before committing to action.</p>\n<h3><strong>How Does MindTime Relate to the Core Drives?</strong></h3>\n<p>Core Drive #4 (Ownership &amp; Possession) is a drive that is typically concerned with the present (how do I acquire more to optimize my experience of the here and now). Medium levels of ownership may be a stronger driving force for the present thinker. However, in terms of achieving highly valued rewards or status, all three archetypes would feel an immense sense of gratification over this type of attainment.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Core Drive #5, (Social influence &amp; Relatedness) would also carry a sense of fulfillment that would be universal to all three thinking styles.</p>\n<p>However, when it comes to Core Drive #8 (Loss &amp; Avoidance) as well as managing resources to prevent Core Drive #6 (Scarcity &amp; Impatience), present and past thinkers may excel at overcoming extreme challenges within these areas. But these game contexts may frustrate future thinkers, depending on the design.</p>\n<p>Game scenarios associated with Core Drive #7 (Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity) often times lacks precedents from which to draw reliable conclusions about how to proceed. This can be frustrating for past thinkers who tend to guard against loss and depend on data to best meet their goals.</p>\n<p>An Octalysis final score would provide information about how balanced the game is in terms of engaging the eight core drives of players. However, the profiling insights of a MindTime analysis would give\u00a0a more in-depth look into the thought processes of players and therefore these nuances can\u00a0be integrated\u00a0into\u00a0specific aspects of the game design.</p>\n<p>The success of a gamification design does not lie in technical sophistication alone. It is invariably conceived in the emotions, thoughts, and reactions of actual players.</p>\n<p>The concept of <em>reading</em> into the mindset of an audience may seem idealistic. However, the use of frameworks like Octalysis and MindTime (among others) make it possible to make better design decisions that are\u00a0more authentically aligned with how we interact with the world.</p>\n",

(Sept. 10, 2014) &#8212;</strong> Employee engagement is one of the biggest challenges in the business world, yet recent numbers show many companies are missing opportunities to increase worker motivation.</p>\n<p>A survey conducted by TechnologyAdvice revealed that more than 70 percent of office employees feel digital engagement software would help them perform better at work. In addition, 54 percent of respondents say they would be more likely to perform a task if it incorporated game elements. Despite these preferences, more than two-thirds of those polled say their company is not using any type of digital engagement platform.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe majority of office workers believe that engagement programs and the introduction of game elements would help them at work,\u201d said TechnologyAdvice Content Manager Zach Watson, who authored the study. \u201cWhile the buzz around gamification in the business world appears to have reached its peak, adoption rates remain relatively low. Engagement can be a subjective term with room for interpretation, but it\u2019s clear from our data that better recognizing workers for their contributions, making repetitive work more inviting, and providing a visual record of workplace progress are all major opportunities for current businesses to improve engagement with employees.\u201d</p>\n<p>One reason for low adoption rates could be the need for greater consideration of employee personalities and job functions when deploying employee engagement software. Fifty-five percent of respondents prefer to work in a predominantly collaborative environment, including more than 60 percent of those who work in customer service. However, office employees who work in sales prefer a far more competitive environment.</p>\n<p>Age is also a key consideration for digital engagement platforms and game elements. Ninety percent of 18-24 year olds and more than 80 percent of 25-34 year olds surveyed believe an engagement program would help them at work. Meanwhile, 42 percent of 45-54 year olds and more than half of 55-64 year olds in the survey do not feel they would benefit from an engagement program.</p>\n<p>Wellness programs are the most popular use case, with nearly 30 percent of respondents identifying a health and fitness platform as their most preferred engagement strategy. A points-based rewards system (24.7 percent) and a progress tracking system (17.4 percent) are the next two preferences for participation, ahead of both internal social networks and an office leaderboard ranking system.</p>\n<p>The survey was conducted through a random sample of 398 office workers whose main job functions are in marketing, customer service, or sales. The full study and more information on its methodology are available <a href=\"http://technologyadvice.com/gamification/blog/survey-office-based-employees-want-digital-engagement-programs/\">here</a>.</p>\n",

My first ever business was an eBay business), as well as made the world a better place through reused resources and materials. More relevant in this context, they made buying and selling online a lot more fun.</p>\n<h3><!--more-->Presenting to the King</h3>\n<p>This week, I had the extreme honor of being invited to eBay to do a 5-Hour Workshop, and while I can&#8217;t really disclose much about why I was there or any specifics on eBay, I thought it would be intriguing to my blog readers the content I put together that helps people understand Gamification and my framework Octalysis better. The items relating to eBay within are both generic and public.</p>\n<p>At first, I was concerned that I would run out of material before covering 5 hours of straight content, but after preparing some more, I realized 5 hours was a bit short to cover how to create a well-designed gamification campaign. A lot of thought goes into something well-designed, even though the output could just be a simple button. That thought goes way beyond, &#8220;where do I put my badges?&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Elephant-Slayer in the Room</h3>\n<p>The nature of most of my talks is that I always need to clear up Misconceptions in the Gamification Industry &#8211; that gamification is &#8220;games/a fad/useless/not for serious companies&#8221; or that it&#8217;s a terrible term. Well, it actually isn&#8217;t that great of a term. I&#8217;ve spoken over and over again how Gamification is really &#8220;<a title=\"What is Gamification\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/gamification/\" target=\"_blank\">Human-Focused Design</a>&#8221; (as opposed to &#8220;Function-Focused Design&#8221;) and since the gaming industry is the first that mastered it, we are learning from games and calling it &#8220;gamification.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what the industry picked up, and sometimes you just gotta go with the flow. You wouldn&#8217;t be reading this blog if I called this &#8220;Yu-kai Chou and Human-Focused Design.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once I clarify through that &#8211; I go into the meat of using Octalysis to implement actionable gamifiication into a campaign or product. I even introduced Octalysis Level 2 and 3, something that I have not published at all about at this point.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the slides and feel free to ask me questions in the comments!</p>\n",

In one, to work, in the other, to enjoy life and have fun. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way.</p>\n<p>There doesn&#8217;t have to be a barrier between the two. If you know how to gamify your life well &#8211; gamify systems, gamify employment, your life will be happier and more productive. That is where my passion exists. Although gamification has gained a new &#8220;buzz status,&#8221; we want to go beyond the surface and understand the potential and promise of this growing field by implementing good gamification design. <a style=\"color: #0f3647;\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.17.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4752\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.17.jpg?resize=487%2C365&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Yu-kai Chou presenting the importance of good gamification design in his Advanced Octalysis Gamification Design Workshop\" width=\"487\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.17.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.17.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The goal is to explore what good gamification design is, and how to achieve it through my\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Octalysis Framework</a>.\u00a0 In that context, my aim is to guide everyone through a deep exploration of what makes a game fun and in turn, employ those same pleasant and engaging elements in real-world, productive situations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In a wider perspective, I show how to use gamification, or Human-Focused Design, to improve your professional and personal life, as well as the lives of those around you.</p>\n<p><a style=\"color: #0f3647;\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.18.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4753\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.18.jpg?resize=494%2C370&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Yu-kai presenting in front of a captive audience at his Advanced Octalysis Gamification Design Workshop\" width=\"494\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.18.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.18.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A brief review of the agenda highlights the key workshop goals &#8211; to present the fundamentals of Octalysis and then develop a practical strategy to address real situations.

Everyone was also invited to check out the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/octalysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook group &#8211; the Octalysis Explorers</a>.

Though it seems rather complicated, the fundamental idea is that everything you do is based on one or more of eight core psychological drives.</p>\n<p>There is an underlying (hidden) ninth core drive &#8211; &#8220;Sensation&#8221;, but since most of our design projects concern psychological motivation, we will concentrate on these fundamental eight core drives. For the workshop we explore Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 of my Octalysis platform. \u00a0At Level 1 we do a quick rundown of the 8 Core Drives (these are publicly shared on my blogposts so take advantage of them while they are there!):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-1-epic-meaning-calling/#.U60clo1dVUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Core Drive 1 &#8211; Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</strong></span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-2-development-accomplishment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Core Drive 2 &#8211; Development &amp; Accomplishment</strong></span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-3-empowerment-creativity-feedback/#.U60c_Y1dVUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Core Drive 3 &#8211; Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback\u00a0</strong></span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-4-ownership-possession/#.U60dG41dVUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Core Drive 4 &#8211; Ownership &amp; Possession</strong></span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-of-gamification-5-social-pressure-and-envy/#.U60deo1dVUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Core Drive 5 &#8211; Social Influence &amp; Relatedness</strong></span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-6-scarcity-impatience/#.U60dlo1dVUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Core Drive 6 &#8211; Scarcity &amp; Impatience</strong></span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/the-8-core-drives-of-gamification-7-unpredictability/#.U60dtI1dVUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Core Drive 7 &#8211; Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity</strong></span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-loss-and-avoidance/#.U60dz41dVUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Core Drive 8 &#8211; Loss &amp; Avoidance</strong></span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I note the\u00a0grouping of core drives into Left Brain vs Right Brain characteristics, and White Hat vs Black Hat characteristics. \u00a0Left Brain Core Drives: 2, 4, 6 &#8211; are associated with analytical thought and demonstrate extrinsic tendency, while the Right Brain Core Drives: 3, 5, 7 &#8211; are associated with emotional thought and demonstrate intrinsic tendency. With White Hat Core Drives: 1, 2, 3 &#8211; you feel more positive and in control.</p>\n<p>With Black Hat\u00a0Core Drives: 6, 7, 8 &#8211; you feel more negative and not in control. However,\u00a0Black Hat motivation often emphasizes urgency which can be skillfully applied in certain situations. For hands-on practice, participants created\u00a0Octalysis charts for their chosen games to explore\u00a0how strong the eight\u00a0core drives were expressed\u00a0by using the <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/octalysis-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Octalysis Tool</a> developed by Ron Bentata (hailing from Israel, getting married this month, and whom also was part of the online attendees!). <a style=\"color: #0f3647;\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Tool1.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4790\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Tool1.png?resize=398%2C362&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image of Octalysis Tool\" width=\"398\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Tool1.png?resize=300%2C273&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Tool1.png?w=737&amp;ssl=1 737w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a> With Level 2 Octalysis, we walk everyone through the four different phases of engagement in a game. The four stages being Discovery, Onboarding, Scaffolding, and Endgame.</p>\n<p>Though\u00a0it\u00a0may seem\u00a0intuitive to think of a single comprehensive experience, when you think about how to design for engagement, everything is different depending on where in the process the user is.</p>\n<p>Their perspective is different throughout the different stages of awareness and familiarity. You will likely view a game from a completely different perspective as a beginner\u00a0than\u00a0that of a seasoned expert. It is important to design with these phases in mind.</p>\n<p>With Level 3 Octalysis, we factor in the different player types as they proceed through the different phases of game engagement. Here, as an example, we\u00a0used Richard Bartle&#8217;s well known four Player Types &#8211; Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, and Killers, and explain their significant\u00a0characteristics and Core Drives.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that\u00a0Bartle also observed that people will often change player types as they go through the different phases of the game. I also point out that the player types in Level 3 Octalysis does not need to be established player types, but could be personas or &#8220;hardcore vs new users.&#8221;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4750\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4750\" style=\"width: 456px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.15.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4750\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.15.jpg?resize=456%2C336&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Yu-kai reviewing participants' Octalysis Charts\" width=\"456\" height=\"336\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4750\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I look ready for a dynamic lunch.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>We conclude the morning session by breaking for lunch to let everyone, including myself, re-energize.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><strong>Lunch Break &#8211; Time relax and prepare for more Advanced\u00a0Octalysis</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">I take a moment to relax in one of the bean bags.

I&#8217;ll talk about the basics of the Strategy Dashboard at another time, but below is the quick diagram. <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Process.1.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-4814 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Process.1.png?resize=429%2C322&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The Process.1\" width=\"429\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Process.1.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Process.1.png?w=793&amp;ssl=1 793w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Lots of Examples and Many Analyses by the Participants</strong></h3>\n<p>From here we go through numerous Octalysis examples, covering level 1, 2, and 3 analyses in greater depth. From that a rich flow of new ideas and features came out, but obviously in any design campaign, you can&#8217;t implement all your ideas.</p>\n<p>So we went through a process (I call it the EE Feature List) to define what are the features that should be implemented in the next iteration, and what should be reserved for future releases (as well as the ones that should be abandoned).</p>\n<p>Once that process is over,\u00a0we briefly (after all the great participation from attendees, we were even short on time with 8.5 hours!) talked about how to construct a basic concept wire frame schematic\u00a0that illustrates the progress of the user experience and covers all possible paths that a user can take through the process.</p>\n<p>During the\u00a0process we arrive at Level 4 Octalysis, which is a process that is a TON of work, but leaves nothing up to chance &#8211; every aspect of a users experience is considered and optimized. A fully Level 4 Octalysis campaign could take months to execute on, but I sincerely believe that, if done correctly, there is almost no chance that you won&#8217;t massively improve your business metrics.</p>\n<h3>Gamified Activities, Darts, and Fun</h3>\n<p>All the participants were involved in exercises to reinforce the concepts and fundamentals presented during\u00a0the workshop. Each was encouraged to present their problems and discuss their analysis of the significant core drives, as well as key components of their\u00a0Strategy\u00a0Dashboard.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4749\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4749\" style=\"width: 392px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.14.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4749\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.14.jpg?resize=392%2C294&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Participant presenting an Octalysis Design for a Project\" width=\"392\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.14.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Octalysis-Workshop-140614.14.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4749\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Presenting a problem and its Octalysis analysis.</figcaption></figure>\n<a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Tree-of-Darts.2.jpg\"></a> The &#8220;Tree of Darts.&#8221;\n<p>On-site participants were further encouraged to present their work through the attraction of a set of magnetic darts. With each successful demonstration of their Octalysis competence, a participant would receive one dart, which could be used to win a special prize.</p>\n<p>Each dart came from my &#8220;Tree of Darts&#8221;, and could be used for one chance of winning\u00a0a powerful and Unique Item if the person earned the highest score. Here instead of giving a Fixed-Action Reward (Earned Lunch with CD4), we added some Core Drive 7: Unpredictability as well as Core Drive 3: Empowerment to incentive the Desired Actions of participating more in the workshop. Jokingly, online attendees asked if they could earn &#8220;virtual darts&#8221;, but unfortunately, that was only reserved for those who attended in-person.</p>\n<p>The Unique Item\u00a0was a recycled-paper plate with hand-written Chinese calligraphy that my cousin (who remained my best friend throughout the years and Best Man at my wedding)\u00a0made for\u00a0me in my fourth grade when I was coming to the US. It expressed best wishes from him on my journey to the States, and I have kept it ever since.</p>\n<p>This Unique Item that is substantially meaningful to me personally not only warrants a 100% refund from the attendee (a $1,000 value), but also makes ALL my future workshops, talks, and seminars FREE if the unique item is brought to the event. \u00a0Most special of all &#8211; it is be transferrable. WHOEVER brings the Unique Item will come to my events for FREE.</p>\n<p>People laughed about how it could\u00a0be sold on eBay for $1 Million after ten years. Dana L., a Surgeon at the Stanford University Medical Center, came on stage with a big smile, &#8220;Your darts are working super well! I usually never go up and talk, but I want those darts!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Possibly also as a joke, many attendees even asked if they could pay money to get more darts, increasing their chances of winning.\u00a0It looks like my\u00a0motivation design\u00a0process worked! Funnily, before the event, I called my cousin (his name is Winston Wang and runs an <a href=\"http://acupunctureorange.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acupuncture Clinic in Orange County</a> &#8211; if he&#8217;s on your side, I&#8217;m on your side) to see if he would be okay with it, as I didn&#8217;t want him to feel like I&#8217;m just throwing away what is meaningful from him as a prize to strangers.</p>\n<p>He responded, &#8220;Well, I am a little bit sad&#8230;but that&#8217;s because now I regret I didn&#8217;t make more of these when we were little.&#8221; In addition to the Unique Item, there would be community voting on who did the best Octalysis Design throughout the workshop. First place would receive a 100% full refund, and second place would receive a 50% refund.</p>\n<p>To my shocking surprise, after 8.5 hours, the online attendees (many of them on different continents, staying up from 11PM to 7:30AM) asked if they could vote too. I would have just passed out myself, but they wanted to participate to the end! Four participants\u00a0were nominated and selected by those in attendance in the VAULT, to be the finalists for the best design awards.</p>\n<p>The grand winner was Kathryn Clubb &#8211; a full refund of her workshop fee. Second place went to Mike Finney &#8211; a 50% refund of his workshop fee.

Also, throughout the months, I have received many complaints of people from other continents that the timing for their timezone just wouldn&#8217;t be possible.</p>\n<p>I think what I will do in the future, is perhaps run an online workshop every quarter (and a physical once a year), each catering to different continents. It could also be broken down into three days &#8211; 4 hours each, with the option of just signing up for separate days (if someone does not want to pay for the basic foundation anymore). Still need to think about this some more.</p>\n<p>Overall, the event was an exciting, inspiring day and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing each of our attendees accomplish amazing things with their new and refined gamification skills.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all who attended at the VAULT and around the world!

It doesn&#8217;t mean I am asserting my own beliefs onto others, and I&#8217;m certainly not claiming that people who don&#8217;t have similar beliefs are worse people, but since this site is YukaiChou.com, I figured that Who I am (Taiwanese Third Culture Citizen), What I believe (Christian Bible), and What I do (Gamification Designer and Entrepreneur) are all topical and relevant here.</p>\n<p>The above presentation is the most complete document of my life, where I lived, some obstacles I faced, companies I started and how I came to faith from a skeptic who used to challenge and make fun Christians. I certainly know how annoying it is to be preached upon with irrelevant circular logic and accusations of not having faith in something that just sounds ridiculous. I generally just offer my prayers when people seem to be in need, and generally they do appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, publicly proclaiming about one&#8217;s Christian faith is like the new walking out of the closet (though I do have a lot of empathy of the sufferings of those who do that, as well as admire their courage of doing so). You feel that people instantly start to judge you. Publicly sharing about my Christian faith has also denied me some opportunities. There have been \u00a0companies that decided not to have a partnership with my website because the author of the site states that he is a Follower of Christ. Perhaps even some of you would stop reading anymore after you see this &#8211; sometimes I switch from being in a position of being respected\u00a0to needing to defend my own intelligence. I&#8217;ve been on the skeptic side &#8211; I know (I used to think a lot of the most famous Christians are all actors. That&#8217;s worse than intellectual naivety &#8211; that&#8217;s morally dishonest).</p>\n<p>The renowned author Malcolm Gladwell recently became a devout Christian too. Chi-Hua Chien, Partner of the top VC Firm Kleiner Perkins, has been a devout Christian for many years too. Clearly there has to at least be something there right?</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I was invited by a Christian organization to talk about my experiences, so I did a talk like that for the first time in my life, and I thought I would share it on my blog too.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m actually really into talking about hard and challenging questions people have about my faith, even if it is rude. So feel free to shoot them over.</p>\n<p>Alright. Stay awesome, and enjoy the slides \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

The wonderful GSummit 2014 has come and gone and because there was a lot to process, I decided to\u00a0share a few things that I learned at GSummit as well as a few links to presentation slides, Twitter accounts, and some key resources.</p>\n<p>Reader beware: Since some of the material is from my notes, mistakes are possible. In any case,\u00a0I encourage you, the reader, to dive deeper where possible. Finally, I credit all the great knowledge to the excellent presenters- thank you for sharing your wisdom!</p>\n<p>We begin with the first official day of the conference, Wednesday, June 11<sup>th</sup>, 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>First Day: Wednesday, June 11th</strong></p>\n<p>After some breakfast, hugging old friends and meeting new ones, it was time to watch the fun begin on the main stage. The friendly \u201cWelcome to GSummit 2014\u201d by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gzicherm\" target=\"_blank\">Gabe Zichermann</a> came and went. The first presentation called \u201cGAMIFY: What is the Future of Gamification?\u201d began.</p>\n<h3><strong>GAMIFY: What is the Future of Gamification?\u201d </strong>by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brian__burke\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Burke</a></h3>\n<p>Brian points out that digital business is forcing organizations to figure out how best to engage and motivate others both internally and externally. The physical and digital worlds are being blurred together.</p>\n<p>Weight Watchers was an example of a struggling company in this Digital Business age. Weight watchers is commonly pointed out as a Gamification example that\u2019s been around for about 50 years.</p>\n<p>Lately, its stock and revenue have been doing worse now that certain solutions like MyFitnessPal, FitBit and other digital solutions have become available.</p>\n<p>There may come a day when work / life balance is achieved through a digital dashboard with a virtual assistant named Samantha to help you. I look forward to that day.</p>\n<p>My key takeaway is:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gamification&amp;src=hash\">#gamification</a> is middleware for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23motivation&amp;src=hash\">#motivation</a>&#8221; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brian__burke\">@brian__burke</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gsummit&amp;src=hash\">#gsummit</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Mathias Vermeulen (@MathVermeulen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MathVermeulen/statuses/477459182702968832\">June 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/andreakuszewski/g-summit-14behaviorakfinal\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Persuasion, Motivation, and Behavior: The Science of When and Why the Rules Don\u2019t (Always) Work</strong></a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndreaKuszewski\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea Kuszewski</a>.</h3>\n<p>Moving ahead to Andrea\u2019s presentation, we take a deep dive into some science backed thinking on motivation.</p>\n<p>The principles of human behavior can fall into three categories: Identity, Context, and Personality.</p>\n<p>Cognitive Dissonance can occur when \u201cour identity is being threatened by the outside world.\u201d We end up holding on to our challenged beliefs even stronger. If it is an outsider or \u201coutgroup\u201d challenging the belief, our sometimes minor belief becomes a strongly held belief! The solution is to have someone in the \u201cingroup\u201d present the idea for better consideration.</p>\n<p>Jumping into the topic of extrinsic motivation, providing an incentive such as money for something that is creative, yields a worse result. That\u2019s because money is an extrinsic motivator. It\u2019s best to just let the creativity flow.</p>\n<p>Punishment is a short term solution. Punishment doesn\u2019t work for motivation in the long term. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t ever work. When the threat of punishment is removed, the chances of doing improper behavior is higher than before.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean for\u00a0Gamification\u00a0design?</p>\n<p>Happiness and Meaning are primary drivers for Approach Motivation. When people go after goals or positive emotions, they are driven by Approach Motivation. The behavior of Meaningful Masochists is self-sustaining.</p>\n<p>However, the Happy Hedonists have less loyalty and don\u2019t exhibit self-sustaining behaviors. Please see the slides using the link above for a deeper look into these behavior profiles.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re left with this final note of wisdom: \u201cThe only way to guarantee long-term sustainable behavior change is to make them want to change their behavior.\u201d So, inspire the Meaningful Masochist inside of the individual by making the desired behavior meaningful.</p>\n<h3><strong>Puzzle Solved: How to Create Long-term Change from Short-term Motivation </strong>by\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bjfogg\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dr. BJ Fogg</strong></a></h3>\n<p>Moving on to the highly respected Dr. BJ Fogg who presented the <a href=\"http://www.behaviormodel.org\" target=\"_blank\">Behavior Model</a>.\u00a0The model&#8217;s equation is \u201cB = m a t\u201d where a behavior will occur in response to a trigger if motivation and ability are high enough. In addition to the Behavior Model, a <a href=\"http://behaviorgrid.org\" target=\"_blank\">Behavior Grid</a> was passed out to all and its proper use reviewed.</p>\n<p>As a side note, Dr. Fogg says, we should not use terms like intrinsic and extrinsic. They cloud things up. There are better ways of talking about things. However, I believe the two terms have value at this time. For a description of the two terms, see <a href=\"http://community.lithium.com/t5/Science-of-Social-blog/Intrinsic-vs-Extrinsic-Motivation-Clearing-the-Fog-not-Fogg/ba-p/128039\" target=\"_blank\">Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation\u2014Clearing the Fog (not Fogg!)</a> by Dr. Mike Wu.</p>\n<p>Finally, Dr. Fogg says that if a desired behavior is not being done, you can troubleshoot it by looking at the following things; trigger, motivation, and ability.</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/gzicherm/gsummit-sf-2014-hooked-how-to-build-habitforming-products-by-nir-eyal-nireyal\" target=\"_blank\">Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</a>\u00a0</strong>by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nireyal\">Nir Eyal</a></h3>\n<p>At GSummit 2014, Nir shares that there is a distinction between a habit and an addiction. He says, \u201cA habit is a behavior done with little or no conscious thought.\u201d An addiction is a \u201ccompulsive dependence on a behavior or substance.\u201d</p>\n<p>We want to create good habit-forming products and not design for addiction. We can create a habit-forming product if the user uses the product with enough frequency to solve a problem so that a positive habit is formed.</p>\n<p>The Hook Model was shared which consists of the following sequential design steps: A Trigger, Action, Reward and Investment. This forms the acronym ATARI. Of special note, the investment phase loads the next trigger and the cycle continues through a second hook model loop.</p>\n<p>He referred to BJ Fogg\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.behaviormodel.org\" target=\"_blank\">Behavior Model</a> of \u201cB = m a t\u201d described above. Ways of affecting motivation and ability are shown. Also three types of variable rewards were reviewed; 1) <a href=\"http://www.nirandfar.com/2013/02/designing-to-reward-our-tribal-sides.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rewards of the Tribe</a> 2) Rewards of the Hunt 3) Rewards of the Self. We build variable rewards to scratch the users itch (solve a problem) but leave them wanting more.</p>\n<p>Finally, he challenges us to \u201cBuild the change you want to see in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gave a shout out to the user created <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/hookmodel\" target=\"_blank\">Hook Model discussion group</a>, his blog at <a href=\"http://nirandfar.com\" target=\"_blank\">nirandfar.com</a> and several GSummit 2014 audience members commented on Twitter that they looked forward to reading his book, titled <a href=\"http://www.hookmodel.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hooked</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Day: Thursday, June 12th</strong></p>\n<p>After a tasty breakfast at GSummit 2014, the fun continued.</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/NicoleLazzaro/g-summit-2014-science-of-fun-nicole-lazzaro-slides-100-nl201406012\" target=\"_blank\">The Science of Fun: 3 Ways Games Make Us Happier</a>\u00a0</strong>by\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicoleLazzaro\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nicole Lazzaro</strong></a></h3>\n<p>Nicole presented the DOSE acronym of Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin, and Endorphin. The parts of DOSE apply to the four different kinds of fun: Hard, Easy, People, Serious. Each kind of fun has unique emotions felt for each.</p>\n<p>She handed out a piece of paper that the audience used throughout the presentation in order to understand better what ties together the <a href=\"http://www.4k2f.com\" target=\"_blank\">4 Keys to Fun</a> and DOSE. Part of the exercise involved hand shaking and hugs which was certainly an audience favorite!</p>\n<h3><strong>Data-Driven Marketing, Loyalty &amp; Gamification</strong> by Jeff Hawley</h3>\n<p>Jeff described the journey for tying data from different places together. There are different kinds of data that can be gathered up across different situations. You can get behavioral data from web data, demographic data from social data, and transactional data from game data.</p>\n<p>A key take away for me was to not operate loyalty in a silo. You can connect data to CRM and CRM to sales data. Also, loyalty, Gamification and marketing lines are getting blurred.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Internet of Things: Using Technology to Engage </strong>by Jerry Filipiak</h3>\n<p>Mobile is hot. We all know that. Due to micro-location beacon technology such as Apple\u2019s iBeacon, people using their mobile devices will interact with their environment with the precision of a few millimeters as opposed to GPS which is 3 feet or more.</p>\n<p>This opens the door to a \u201cphysical graph\u201d where everything is interact-able. Beacon technology also can provide a heat trail for A/B testing in physical stores. Cheaper smartphones are coming out too so more people can interact with the beacon technology. It is important that these solutions be designed in an engaging way as opposed to being creepy.</p>\n<h3><strong>Level Up Your Gamification to Solve Big Business Problems</strong> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mich8elwu\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Michael Wu</a></h3>\n<p>Author&#8217;s note: (For some Wu slides, see section 10 at http://g-era.co/theory/gsummit\u00a0where it says \u201cMichael Wu taught us..\u201d)</p>\n<p>Michael covered some Gamification basics and then quickly moved into deeper Gamification. He also impressively showed how to design a sustainable Gamification project over time and how the game choices are introduced along the way.</p>\n<p>As Michael said, some common uses of Gamification are to deepen engagement, sustain loyalty, and onboard new users.</p>\n<p>He reminds us that most games have an end. People don\u2019t, won\u2019t and can\u2019t play continuously. I have seen successful Gamified systems that have an end date. So, I know where Michael is coming from especially in the domain of loyalty programs.</p>\n<p>Angry birds has feedback, control, physics, and points. You can achieve things like leveling up and be high on a leaderboard. You can acquire skills and get into a state of flow.</p>\n<p>How to get into flow?</p>\n<p>The player\u2019s skills increase so the difficulty also needs to increase. So, give players baby steps to conquer at first. Those steps are key to habit formation.</p>\n<p>As said above, throughout the presentation, he also highlighted how one can create a Gamified solution in a sustainable way. As opposed to picking one key takeaway, I have to say that all of the above items were excellent lessons to continue reflecting upon.</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/VirginPulse/game-on-how-wearable-fitness-tech-is-changing-employee-health-wellness-36077361\" target=\"_blank\">Game on! How wearable fitness tech is changing employee health and wellness</a>\u00a0</strong>by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shawnlavana\" target=\"_blank\">Shawn LaVana</a></h3>\n<p>As was said, 70% of employees aren&#8217;t engaged, 75% are not eating well, 79% are not getting enough exercise. This all impacts companies.</p>\n<p>Their company, Virgin Pulse, approaches things based on the question \u201cWhat can we do to help employees be their best?\u201d They want to empower employees with energy, focus, and drive.</p>\n<p>There are over 100,000 consumer health and fitness apps with over 1.5 billion downloads per year. These devices are not just for fitness fanatics. Consumers of all sorts will come to rely on them. They figure out a baseline, help them improve, and get them engaged.</p>\n<p>Through Gamification, employees will be able to see progress, feedback, receive recognition and rewards, reminders, and receive social support. Since I am a fan of Gamified fitness, the future looks bright indeed!</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oTTQil50K1o43sj8xxHQLV1Etxf2G6G0EZLG-4lluD4/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Gamestorming Wikipedia: An Experiment in Playful Onboarding</a>\u00a0</strong>by\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JakeOrlowitz\" target=\"_blank\">Jake Orlowitz</a></h3>\n<p>Wikipedia&#8217;s core ideals are Neutrality, Verifiability, Consensus, Civility, and Openness. Supporting these ideals is the on-boarding solution called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:The_Wikipedia_Adventure\" target=\"_blank\">The Wikipedia Adventure</a>.</p>\n<p>The strategies behind this solution are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invite</li>\n<li>Acknowledge</li>\n<li>Show off the people by showing their pictures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Showing people\u2019s faces makes them feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves. Empathy is also encouraged by this.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The playful design lowers the fear of failure, encourages you to try new things, and have fun. You learn the skills and enjoy yourself.</p>\n<p>They key takeaway for me is that the on-boarding experience is \u201csaturated\u201d with positive reinforcement. Something good to emulate indeed!</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/amyjokim/the-coop-revolution-7-rules-for-collaborative-game-design\" target=\"_blank\">The Co-op Revolution: 7 Rules for Collaborative Game Design</a>\u00a0</strong>by <a href=\"http://gsummit2014.sched.org/speaker/amyjokim\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Amy Jo Kim</a></h3>\n<p>Amy Jo Kim\u2019s collaborative design approach was well received at GSummit 2014.</p>\n<p>Although the \u201cCo-op Revolution is Here\u201d, it\u2019s not everywhere. There\u2019s a move towards \u201cnon-zero-sum\u201d games and experiences. A zero-sum game is where one player wins and the other player loses. In contrast, the players are partners in a non-zero-sum game. It\u2019s possible to have more fun and even accomplish more working together.</p>\n<p>There are 7 rules for a Co-op design:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compete with the System</li>\n<li>Shared Goals &amp; Outcomes</li>\n<li>Inter-dependent Roles</li>\n<li>Co-op Social Gestures</li>\n<li>Shared Resources</li>\n<li>Non-Zero Stats &amp; Spotlights</li>\n<li>User-generated Content</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A main takeaway is that \u201cnot everyone is motivated by zero-sum mechanics.\u201d<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Space Race &#8211; </strong>Yellow Team Won</h3>\n<p>Soon after Amy Jo Kim\u2019s presentation, GSummit 2014 set up a \u201cSpace Race\u201d between <a href=\"http://livecube.co\" target=\"_blank\">Live Cube</a> teams that were in the audience. People would click as fast as they could to fuel their team\u2019s ship and make it go up. It was a lot of fun! I say with pride that my team, team yellow, won the space race.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>GSummit 2014 Closing Keynote</strong></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://fora.tv/embed?id=15568&amp;type=h\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fora.tv/v/15568\" target=\"_blank\">Gabe Zichermann: Fun Makes Hookups and Workouts More Fun</a> from <a href=\"http://fora.tv/partner/Gamification_Co\" target=\"_blank\"> Gamification Co</a> on <a href=\"http://fora.tv\" target=\"_blank\">FORA.tv</a></p>\n<p>There were several interesting points shared during the GSummit 2014 Closing Keynote. One interesting focus was on habituation. Habituation allows us to take external stimuli and turn the volume down on it. Otherwise, we would be overcome with it all. It also is what makes yesterday\u2019s exciting thing boring to us today. As Gabe said, \u201call the easy problems are solved.\u201d We will need to continue to advance and \u201clevel-up\u201d in our engagement strategies.</p>\n<h3><strong>GSummit 2014 Gamification Awards</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of the GSummit 2014 award recipients included: T-Mobile, Ready Set Jet, Air Canada, SaveUp, GT Academy, ClassDojo, XPRIZE, and Jane McGonigal.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Science of How Games Make Us Stronger by Jane McGonigal</strong></h3>\n<p>Jane is applying the science of <a href=\"http://www.superbetter.com\" target=\"_blank\">SuperBetter</a> herself to help her write a book. Specifically, she writes \u201cI love writing this book\u201d on her calendar. On another personal note, she has sage advice which is \u201cknow your neighbors.\u201d She recommends really nourishing the neighborhood relationships. You never know when you may need their help.</p>\n<p>While talking about relationships, she points out that people who play games with you will support you in real life. Online communities combined with reality is a good thing. She referred to the earlier GSummit 2014 presentation by Amy Jo Kim where giving a person an extra life in a game will make a person more likely to help you in real life.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer games in general are good with one \u201cpublic service announcement\u201d exception that Jane pointed which and is <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j3ao/i_am_game_designer_researcher_jane_mcgonigal_ama/cgdijb6\" target=\"_blank\">echoed here</a>: \u201cplaying very aggressive, competitive games against strangers online (think call of duty) can boost your testosterone levels way too high for your own good.\u201d</p>\n<p>On an upbeat note, <a href=\"http://janemcgonigal.com/2014/03/27/help-prevent-ptsd\" target=\"_blank\">playing Tetris within 6 hours</a> of a traumatic event reduces the likelihood of PTS, Post Traumatic Stress. Jane, we all thank you for your \u201c..<a href=\"http://janemcgonigal.com/play-me\" target=\"_blank\">goal of ending suffering on Earth</a>..\u201d</p>\n<h3><strong>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson!</strong></h3>\n<p>Neil was funny, inspirational and reassuring for all science lovers. Science is popular as evidenced by people embracing symbols of science. He showed several symbols that are products with his face on them.</p>\n<p>One call to action that he shared was that we need to support programs that will identify asteroids that may smash into earth. I agree that it\u2019s important.</p>\n<p><strong>Final Day: Friday, June 13th</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who didn\u2019t attend the Friday workshops missed out. One extremely popular and packed workshop was \u201cActionable Gamification: <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/#.U6iXeo1dVUg\" target=\"_blank\">The Octalysis Framework</a>.\u201d<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/gzicherm/gsummit-sf-2014-handson-lab-actionable-gamification-the-octalysis-framework-by-yukai-chou-yukaichou\" target=\"_blank\">Hands-on Lab: Actionable Gamification: The Octalysis Framework</a>\u00a0</strong>by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yukaichou\" target=\"_blank\">Yu-kai Chou</a></h3>\n<p>There was lots of excitement as people filled the room from end to end.

The audience loved the Gamification vision that Yu-kai shared:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Yu Kai just gave the best definition of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gamification&amp;src=hash\">#gamification</a>: Trying to make real life so great you dont want to escape from it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yukaichou\">@yukaichou</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gsummit&amp;src=hash\">#gsummit</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Pepe Paez (@JosePaez) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosePaez/statuses/477522377728090112\">June 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.octalysis.com\" target=\"_blank\">Octalysis</a> Gamification framework was introduced and shown how it applies to successful products and life in general. People were extremely impressed on how the framework clearly highlights 8 core drives of motivation.</p>\n<p>Yu-kai even shared the <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/octalysis-tool\" target=\"_blank\">Octalysis Tool</a> which is an interactive tool for analyzing motivation using Octalysis. On LiveCube, some mentioned the <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-workshop/finally-advanced-octalysis-gamification-design-workshop-2\" target=\"_blank\">full-day Octalysis workshop</a> that Yu-kai gave the next day. People stated that they wished they could go too (spoiler: it was awesome).</p>\n<h3><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h3>\n<p>GSummit 2014 was fantastic! It was a mix of scientific backed information and practical actionable advice. In response to the question of \u201cwhat do I do with this knowledge I have been given?,\u201d I recommend people put this new found knowledge to good use. For many, the most straight forward thing to do is to choose one or two frameworks that help make this all tangible and actionable. Based on my experience, I recommend looking at the <a href=\"http://www.hookmodel.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hook Model</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.octalysis.com\" target=\"_blank\">Octalysis</a> framework.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/finneycanhelp\" target=\"_blank\">finneycanhelp</a> aka Mike Finney of <a href=\"http://www.carfax.com\" target=\"_blank\">CARFAX\u00a0</a></p>\n",

You won\u2019t regret it!</a></p>\n<p>My\u00a03-day online progressive workshop on Octalysis Gamification for Asian/Australian timezones start this weekend! From now until Friday, you can get 10% off of your Day 1 and Day 2 ticket by entering\u00a0<strong>TierVIIEarlyBird</strong>\u00a0in the Enter Promotional Code box.</p>\n<p>Important to remember that for those in the US, the workshop begins Friday, December 5th ( at 7pm for those on the west coast). For those in Asia/Australian workshops, the workshop will begin the afternoon of the 6th.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a summary I wrote last week on what to expect:</p>\n<p>One of the frustrations I have is that, in all my public speeches, since I can never assume the audience have previous knowledge of Octalysis, I always have to cover the fundamentals of gamification as a whole, Human-Focused Design, and the 8 Core Drives of Octalysis. As a result, I keep making similar talks over and over without being able to go in depth of unleashing the powers of the 8 Core Drives to improve peoples\u2019 designs.</p>\n<p>As a result, I started to do 3-Day (4 hours a day) online workshops with a variety of attendees from all over the world. I\u2019m thinking about doing three to four of these a year, each being in a different time of the day so other continents can find a time to comfortably attend too.</p>\n<p>We recently just finished the first European/US time zone focused 3-Day Online Workshop, and it was a tremendous success! <strong>Over 40 people took part in this great journey</strong> of learning and applying the 8 Core Drive, Octalysis Strategy Dashboard, and creating Concept Wireframes towards their own projects.</p>\n<p>A few have already written to me about how taking the workshop has changed the way they do things with a lot of results. An attendee from\u00a0South Africa even gave a very generous testimonial too:</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float: left; margin: 5px;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-02-at-8.27.46-PM.png?resize=85%2C98&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"85\" height=\"98\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><span style=\"color: #333333;\">\u00a0&#8220;So I would like to let Yu-Kai and all of you know that one of the companies that I work for has \u00a0already been transformed thanks to the Strategy Dashboard.\u00a0</span></span></em><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">Our projects have a much better \u00a0direction, we have found new ways to monitor the projects as well as monetize them.\u00a0</span></em><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">Our designers \u00a0love it as it has helped them design more focused interfaces with direct links to the actions we want \u00a0to encourage&#8230;.t</span></em><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">he CEO is itching to get on the next course as well.\u00a0</span></em><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">So Thank you Yu-kai Chou You have truly helped me.&#8221;\u00a0</span></em></span><strong>-Ryan Julyan, Former Workshop Attendee\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Quick Summary of the\u00a0</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>Day</strong><strong>\u00a0Gamification Workshops</strong></h2>\n<p>Gamification Workshop Day 1: Fundamentals</p>\n<p>Day\u00a01\u00a0was great as we consolidated much of the 8 Core Drives knowledge so that everyone who has learned from me in the past will have a strong foundation over the motivation design pieces within the framework.</p>\n<p>In my public talks, we merely introduce the 8 Core Drives and list out some examples. In the Day 1 Workshop we went into details about the nature of these 8 Core Drives, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to balance White Hat with Black Hat as well as Left Brain and Right Brain Core Drives.</p>\n<p><strong>It made me happy that a couple folks who finished\u00a0Day\u00a01\u00a0asked if they could do\u00a0Day\u00a02\u00a0last moment.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3>Gamification Workshop Day 2: Implementing a campaign through the Strategy Dashboard</h3>\n<p>Day\u00a02\u00a0was about putting that knowledge into action on a real design project. Even though it was a bit more similar to traditional project management and design learning materials, it is based on the\u00a0Day\u00a01\u00a0foundation and has a strong focus on creating activity loops, reward schedules, and feedback mechanics.</p>\n<p>This is important because so many people figure out how to create great ideas that motivate people when they learn about Octalysis, but fail to incorporate that into a process that outputs a fully engaging system at the end.</p>\n<p>Sometimes just using the Octalysis Strategy Dashboard to define the priority list within Business Metrics and defining the Desired Actions leading to them can really change a business around from my own experience.</p>\n<h3>Gamification Workshop Day 3: Custom Octalysis Design for Attendee Projects</h3>\n<p>To be honest, I was fairly nervous about\u00a0Day\u00a03, since it is always a little bit\u00a0unpredictable \u2013 Core Drive 7. I could prepare for\u00a0Day\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a02, but couldn&#8217;t really prepare for\u00a0Day\u00a03, as it depends on the preparation work of the attendees, questions, and specific cases they present.</p>\n<p>Either no one prepares anything, and I need to come up with things to talk about, or everyone prepares too much and I need to figure out how to make sure everyone gets (and not just the person presenting) a ton of specific case-driven value out of it.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also always the risk where I would end up being like, &#8220;Umm&#8230;.I don&#8217;t know how to solve this problem&#8221; which would make me look pretty bad, haha (although so far I am blessed to not gotten stuck like that yet). I&#8217;m also unsure if other attendees would get bored when I&#8217;m going through improvements on another person&#8217;s project. This also makes\u00a0Day\u00a03\u00a0to be the most fun for me though based on Core Drive3\u00a0principles: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback.</p>\n<p>Luckily,\u00a0Day\u00a03\u00a0turned out to be a big success (Core Drive\u00a02\u00a0accomplishment!). Everyone was engaged, I managed to answer most of the questions, and more importantly showed attendees how to apply the methodology everyone was learning in the past couple of days.</p>\n<p>For some attendees, we drilled down and refined on the fundamentals &#8211; the Strategy Dashboard; for others, we examined through the 8 Core Drives to make their campaigns more engaging; and then for a few we came up with some hyper creative ideas that at the minimum is worth exploring. We covered a multitude of projects, from banking, to medical websites, to a Hollywood movie project, education, and more.</p>\n<p>I smiled in relief when I saw an attendee mention in social media that\u00a0Day\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a02\u00a0were amazing, but\u00a0Day\u00a03\u00a0was the best.</p>\n<h3>Would you like to be part of this journey of being enlightened about how our brains work and improve Desired Behavior?</h3>\n<p>As I said, so far my plan is to run these workshops 3-4 times a year, depending on demand. If you plan to take your life and all your projects to the next level (why aren\u2019t people using my product? Why aren\u2019t my employees motivated? Why aren\u2019t my students studying? Why am I not studying?), you should seriously consider participating in the workshop \u2013 the earlier the better because every week you don&#8217;t have this knowledge is hurting your future wellbeing(I am biased in this statement, but I wholeheartedly believe in it. I use this knowledge literally on a bi-hourly basis and it has transformed my life).</p>\n<p>The next workshop that is coming up is on a weekend that is friendly for Pacific Time, Asia, and Australia.</p>\n<p>And if you read all the way up to this point, you deserve to get <strong>a special 35% discount code \u201cYukaiBlogReader\u201d</strong> that will be effective if you register soon. Do take advantage of it, especially if you have already missed the High Tier Early Bird Discounts!</p>\n<p><a title=\"Gamification Workshop\" href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/3-day-octalysis-gamification-workshop-usaustraliaasia-timezone-tickets-12507352829\" target=\"_blank\">Again, here is the link to Register for the 3-Day Gamification Workshop on Octalysis</a></p>\n",

Others would rather receive intrinsic motivation through recognition and public attention. Studies have been conflicted as to whether an extrinsic rewards system or an intrinsic motivational system is more effective.\u00a0So how do you decide what to offer? How do you find out what your employees really want?</p>\n<p>According to a report issued by the Incentive Research Foundation, the key to successful employee motivation is to have a well-designed program that equally <a href=\"http://theirf.org/research/content/6036704/motivating-todays-workforce-the-future-of-incentive-program-design/\" target=\"_blank\">emphasizes both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards</a>.</p>\n<p>In other words, offering raises, bonuses, and other forms of compensation is a great starting point, but a successful sales incentive program should go beyond that point.</p>\n<p>The key to your employees finding value in the program might have nothing to do with the actual reward at all.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>Extrinsic and Intrinsic Motivation</h3>\n<p>In a report published in 2007, Accenture compared sales program reward structures to Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. In that pyramid, compensation &#8211; through monetary or physical rewards &#8211; is the lowest on the scale. That means it serves the simplest level of a person\u2019s needs &#8211; the need to provide for himself or herself and potentially a family.</p>\n<p>Now, don\u2019t take that the wrong way. Compensation is still valued; if it wasn\u2019t valued, it wouldn\u2019t be on the pyramid at all. But if all of your rewards are monetary or physical &#8211; things like tickets or restaurant gift cards &#8211; once a salesperson achieves that reward, he or she will likely lose motivation to continue on in the program.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll skip the second level for now and come back to it in a moment.</p>\n<p>The third level on the pyramid is esteem, recognition, and respect, which is equated with Maslow\u2019s need for a sense of belonging. This should come as no surprise &#8211; public recognition is frequently used as a motivational factor for sales teams, with great success. This is higher on the pyramid, which means if an employee receives this as a reward, it\u2019s likely going to hold a great deal of value as it serves a \u201chigher need\u201din motivation.</p>\n<p>But the step that comes in between compensation and recognition &#8211; that second level in Maslow\u2019s pyramid &#8211; is one that is often forgotten and potentially the key to increasing the value of whatever rewards are offered, extrinsic or intrinsic.</p>\n<p>According to Accenture, Maslow\u2019s second-level need for feeling safe and secure is equated in the sales world as a sense of trust and assurance. This trust needs to be twofold. The salesperson needs to feel like he or she can be trusted to do the important work at hand. Likewise, he/she needs to trust that the compensation for said work is accurate and reasonable.</p>\n<p>This means that the <em>process</em> that the salesperson goes through in reporting and tracking progress toward an end goal is critical to creating value in any earned reward.</p>\n<p>For example, at the Canadian telecommunications company Telus Corporation, a simple adjustment in the way that salespeople reported information &#8211; as well as transparency in the way that rewards were correspondingly issued &#8211; resulted in a return on investment of 103 percent in the first year of implementation.</p>\n<p>Because of the simpler reporting process, the sales team at Telus was able to spend less time doing paperwork and more time selling. And because of the added transparency of clearly defined goals and the ability to monitor where he or she stood in the process, productivity and motivation increased. The sales team trusted the rewards being issued were earned and not randomly conceived without verification.</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"http://technologyadvice.com/gamification/employee-engagement-solutions/smart-advisor/\">employee engagement software</a>, or a gamification program, is especially beneficial. Many programs offer a wide variety of ways that an employee can track where he or she stands in the process of achieving a new goal or level. And because most platforms are mobile friendly, regardless of whether your salesperson is in the field or in the office, he or she can report progress across devices.</p>\n<p>Another company that has successfully harnessed intrinsic motivation is SAP. The software company has an extremely dedicated online community called the SAP Community Network (SCN) that includes consultants, mentors, and other company-affiliated individuals. The network allows such individuals to share their technical knowledge, and help other users who are encountering issues. As of 2012, there were over 2 million members.</p>\n<p>In order to encourage greater participation, SAP has been experimenting with different game elements on the site for over a decade. During this time, they\u2019ve learned some valuable lessons about what their users truly cared about it. As it turns out, it\u2019s not tangible rewards.</p>\n<p>For a brief period of time near 2006, SAP decided to reward users who collected a certain number of points with company t-shirts. When this ultimately proved to be too logistically difficult to manage, the company decided to scrap the program and ask users how they wanted to spend the program\u2019s remaining budget.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, there was almost no backlash against this, and the community decided to donate the remaining money towards the United Nations World Food Program. As it turned out, users didn\u2019t really care about getting tangible (extrinsic) rewards for their contributions \u2013 what they valued was the social recognition (intrinsic reward) they received from being a top contributor. That\u2019s why the site now displays both a lifetime point total and yearly point total for users \u2013 new visitors don\u2019t feel as if they\u2019ll never catch up, and long-term members can point to their continued involvement.</p>\n<p>SAP now uses the community as both a resource for clients and a way to vet and recognize their best consultants. SCN point totals make up one of the factors in selecting new SAP Mentors, a highly coveted designation within the SAP community. By aligning their rewards with the internal motivations of their users and employees, SAP has successfully established a world-class community and product resource. Most importantly, they\u2019ve avoided devaluing contributions by replacing internal motivation with external rewards.</p>\n<p>When trying to improve workflow efficiency, or streamline internal processes, it\u2019s tempting to take what seems like the most direct route \u2013 large prizes, usually consisting of physical goods. However, when trying to build a sustainable business model and instill best practices in your team, such rewards are often a distraction. Tying incentives to internal motivators means figuring out what actually drives your employees, and creating a holistic program to reward that. It isn\u2019t easy, and it takes some time, but it creates far more value in the long run. In the end, that\u2019s the type of program that will propel your company to continued success.</p>\n",

        "content": {
            "rendered": "<p>Earlier I wrote a post on how Eugene bashed me online, using aggressive language like &#8220;Scam&#8221; and that my work is &#8220;scientifically flawed to the point of absurdity and it must go.&#8221; I then did a full critique of his book too, just like he did mine, and he decided to call me &#8220;criminal&#8221; because of it through another post.</p>\n<p>I was going to just post the below on his blogpost, but unfortunately there was a character limit, so I&#8217;m just posting it here. I won&#8217;t be promoting this piece on any social network (btw, even the first piece, I could be sharing it in the other dominant social media groups for gamification, but I didn&#8217;t because I didn&#8217;t want it to spread everywhere&#8230;just enough so he would recognize that he can&#8217;t just go around accusing people with names&#8230;so just shared on my own private group and personal wall) but I felt I do need to make a statement for myself in public.</p>\n<h3>Response to Eugene:</h3>\n<p><!--more-->Hey Eugene, I&#8217;m not going to go on arguing the little details here in your post (maybe a couple very damaging ones). I want you to understand that you forced me to do everything I have done.</p>\n<p>1. Out of nowhere, you aggressively write a book with the title &#8220;scam&#8221; and throw my name in the title description. You use harsh language like, &#8220;These people don&#8217;t have the first clue&#8221; among other very &#8220;killer-like activities.&#8221; I was going to let it go and just wanted to share with Andrzej and get a kick.</p>\n<p>2. Then you started being aggressive again on Twitter, saying we were just playing our big egos and such. Needless to say, anyone would have been annoyed. If you were me, what would you do here? The fact that you told me you were a fan but then write that my stuff &#8220;has to go&#8221; and that I don&#8217;t have a clue about life makes me feel like you are just playing a very dangerous and annoying game of fame. I was very annoyed, so I wanted you to feel what it&#8217;s like when someone criticizes your work with &#8220;a bad attitude.&#8221; Then you told me to make sure I read the entire thing and not just say anything generic. So I did.</p>\n<p>3. I wrote the piece, not at all trying to defend what you were criticizing me for (again, those are small details outside the personal attacks), but just giving a taste of the same medicine &#8211; someone criticizing your work. I might have read your work more carefully than you did mine. I did not call you names like &#8220;scam&#8221; or anything, but yes I did imply that your previous behavior was rude, aggressive and immature. I didn&#8217;t say anything bad about your school. I actually respect your school. I was implying that your writing clearly shows that you haven&#8217;t graduated college yet. (and of course, many people in college are also very mature)</p>\n<p>4. You continued to attack me on Twitter. I honestly and sincerely asked you to stop pushing me, because I actually didn&#8217;t want you to ruin your career just because you wanted to save face. I think (before your ebook) you were doing the right things, interning at the right places, reading the right books (btw, I also read science books too. I was just saying your point was irrelevant). If you patiently did what you did for a few years and gained more experience, you would be very successful and respected. I may even work with you on my own projects too (I&#8217;ve actually mentioned this to a few people). But you took a path that would have destroyed all the good stuff you have done. It would be a huge shame if you threw everything away like that because of it, so I was almost pleading to you not to push me more. I know I&#8217;m competitive, and I don&#8217;t back down from people who attack me first without me doing anything wrong, but I didn&#8217;t want you to make it worse for yourself (again, your current writing does not brand you well yet, and escalating the matter and the back and forth could only hurt you, not just in the gamification world, but academically [there was a bad incident of the &#8220;UCLA Racist Girl&#8221; who publicly said some, not incorrect but politically insensitive things, and was kicked out of the University&#8230;NO ONE wants that to happen], professionally, and even legally [there are laws against publicly implying that people are scams, especially if it results in monetary/opportunity damage). I asked you not to keep pushing, but let you know again that I don&#8217;t back down when people push. I also didn&#8217;t want everyone on the web to feel like they could copy your aggressive and rude behavior without any consequences. I really didn&#8217;t have too much of a choice if you pushed. Again, what would you do if you were me?</p>\n<p>5. So then you write a blogpost, calling me &#8220;hypocrite&#8221; and &#8220;criminal.&#8221; All I did was write an aggressively critical piece against your work too. How is that hypocritical? Sure, I didn&#8217;t quote everything, but I quoted as much as I could based on the Kindle limits that you set. You on the other hand, just took one blogpost of mine, one paragraph quote, and you felt comfortable labeling with all the things that you did. Don&#8217;t you think that would hurt me too? If you just politely said the &#8220;semantics&#8221; of my Left Brain/Right Brain Core Drives wasn&#8217;t scientific, I would have totally agreed and explained that it&#8217;s just symbolic and to make the tool easier for design purposes (in fact, people have asked me nicely and I have responded nicely). But you had to take the route of calling me work &#8220;scientifically flawed to the point of absurdity and it has to go.&#8221; Again, you didn&#8217;t leave me much choice did you?</p>\n<p>On a few points above you made:</p>\n<p>1. You DID attack us personally, and not just our ideas. You said we &#8220;didn&#8217;t have the first clue&#8221; about things. You did not use the word &#8220;fraud&#8221; but &#8220;scam&#8221; implies the same thing. You did not specifically call ME a scam, but it was implied, just as I didn&#8217;t specifically say anything bad about your education, but you felt I applied it and declared that I did. Implying goes both ways.</p>\n<p>2. I still don&#8217;t agree that &#8220;socailizers are losers IN THE GAME.&#8221; I think socializers just enjoy socializing, regardless of how good they are at the game. I think you are over-generalizing, which I did take the chance to point out that it goes against the anti-reductionist movement that you were very strong on.</p>\n<p>3. I actually didn&#8217;t mention The Winner Effect was your claim to fame because of your blogpost. I did it because after saying everyone&#8217;s stuff is crap, you proposed something that you endorsed, and so I just exaggerated what was supposed to be, &#8220;What he thinks is actually good.&#8221; I just thought the way you presented the information and the examples were pretty funny (the Winner Effect is truly there, but it&#8217;s unclear how you would use it to design a gamification campaign&#8230;make people win a lot through Core Drive 2?) I was just holding you at a higher standard since you completely bashed away everyone else&#8217;s hard work.</p>\n<p>4. I can&#8217;t believe you think I am &#8220;lying in a criminal way&#8221; just because I did not include links to two boring videos. I basically just copy and pasted the entire quote (even included your example and names), and the Kindle copy-paste just didn&#8217;t come with it. I in no way implied (or even thought) that you were sexually deviant. I just implied that many of your examples were about sex and that does not reflect well on you. If you felt that me simply not including two video links but quoting YOUR ENTIRE STATEMENT makes you seem like a sexual deviant, you might want to change your text and sentences. I think if I added the links to the two videos (also happy to do so if you want), that wouldn&#8217;t change anything and would still be pissed and call me a criminal liar another way. Here I just believed you should use better examples to prove your point.</p>\n<p>And no, I completely disagree people are nice only because they fake it and want to gain social status or any extrinsic means (but I agree some do&#8230;again, humans are complex and we are very different). Some people are just nice, for good or for bad. I do however, agree that people with high status get away with things that are not acceptable by people with low status. (Like poor guy who steals $20 gets locked in jail for 30 years, while REAL fraudulent people steal billions and only get locked for 3&#8230;makes me angry). I&#8217;m only saying you can&#8217;t just generalize peoples&#8217; motives of why they are nice, or why they do anything.</p>\n<p>5. See, why do you keep doing stuff like this, &#8220;Maybe if you spent more time in the real-world you&#8217;d learn how to navigate it better&#8221;? I just don&#8217;t get it. It&#8217;s like you are purposely trying to make me angry. Not even saying how good my work experience is, I truthfully have done more in the &#8220;real world&#8221; and have seen more (even if you were smarter, which I&#8217;m not against). It&#8217;s just again, an unnecessary attitude which is plastered all over your book. Anyway, you misunderstood what I was saying. Yes, if a person does repetitive actions, and sees repetitive results, there is no flow. But my point is that because in games, people are doing repetitive actions (like &#8220;throwing out the bird&#8221; repeatedly, &#8220;matching 3 gems&#8221; repeatedly, &#8220;killing the same monsters&#8221; repeatedly) joyfully because there is a sense of growth (also Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment, which supports the Winner Effect &#8211; you do what you feel accomplished on) through good Feedback Mechanics etc etc. My point was that &#8220;Even though the grunt work you give people have REPETITIVE ACTION, through gamification, it is possible to make people more motivated towards it.&#8221; Also, I never used the word Flow in that statement or in that talk, so your point isn&#8217;t even relevant (just like how I don&#8217;t even say how my terminologies are scientific, as I just focus on doing good designs that change behavior).</p>\n<p>6. Again, I don&#8217;t mock your school. I respect it. I was simply saying you behaved like a person who hasn&#8217;t started working for a living yet. Harvard college students could behave the same way too (I have a friends like that). My school&#8217;s not the best either, and that&#8217;s okay. All I ask is that we behave maturely and when you criticize someone&#8217;s work, there is no need to input a bunch of insulting crap in it (again, if you ask why I do it myself, it&#8217;s just because I was just letting you feel what you are doing to others. This is the first time I have ever done so, even though I have been criticized MANY times&#8230;I usually thank the people for pointing it out politely).</p>\n<p>7. Finally, you said your book only criticizes me on the last part about the LB/RB stuff, and you didn&#8217;t criticize me anything about the reductionism stuff. That would be fine if you didn&#8217;t throw my name into the book description with this, &#8220;consultancy practices that have been developed in gamification inspired by his personality types and finding &#8220;players motivations,&#8221; specifically those of Andrzej Marczewski and Yu-Kai Chou Octalysis framework.&#8221; Also, now you state that I have yet to answer your social atomism critique. What was the critique I should answer to? I thought you said you weren&#8217;t attacking me on that besides the LB/RB stuff? See stuff like that is just confusing, like you are just trying to find something to attack. This is the reason why I feel like you are just playing some game.</p>\n<p>Also, regarding your big problem of my semantics. My honest question is, if I just stopped calling it Left Brain Core Drives and Right Brain Core Drives and called it something else like Rainbow and Stone (btw, Jill Bolte Taylor, a Neuroanatomist, in her TED talk also uses Left Brain/Right Brain generalities, but again I could care less), would you really no longer think my work is not so scientifically flawed that it has to go? I just don&#8217;t get what&#8217;s the big problem you have with my work beyond the naming/grouping of Core Drives. I feel like you were just finding something to criticize for publicity sake, and if I chose different terminologies, you would find something else to bash.</p>\n<p>Anyway, like I said I&#8217;m not interested in being in a fight with you, and I would still like you to be extremely successful one day if it didn&#8217;t mean I was going down because of it. I reached out on Twitter to do a live talk (publicly or privately based on your choice) to discuss it out if you are interested in peace. I also said if you want a moderator like Gabe Zichermann (whom you work/worked for), I would be fine with it too.</p>\n<p>Let me know.</p>\n<p>Oh ok, you responded on Twitter that I am unprofessional and you don&#8217;t want to talk. That&#8217;s fine. I don&#8217;t think you need to quit the gamification industry though. I&#8217;m happy to help you as long as you start taking back your aggressive words and act in good faith. Again, you have been doing the right things up until now. I would recommend you keep doing it in a collaborative way in the industry. The Winner/Effect Loser is only there partially. When we lose, we can pick ourselves back up and keep trying. I think you have great talent and a great potential in the gamification world, you just shouldn&#8217;t do to others what you don&#8217;t want done to you.</p>\n<p>Feel free to reach out to me anytime when you feel ready, and I am happy to communicate in peaceful and non-aggressive/non-mocking terms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Why? So he can get virtual goods using the tickets, specifically different balloons and decorations. These fuel Core Drive #4.</p>\n<p>The player feels that it\u2019s his balloon. It becomes a part of him and a reflection of his tastes. He likes exploring the options (Core Drive #7) of what he can own. He wants to see what these options do when they get into the sky such as the flag decoration flying (Core Drive #7).</p>\n<p>When he feels sad, he wants to go into his collection of past personal notes / pictures and be happy again. There\u2019s a variety of different kinds of notes and even some with pictures.</p>\n<p><b>The App Developer</b></p>\n<p>Mindbloom wants the player to feel a sense of ownership by feeling attached to his creations, the configured balloons.</p>\n<p>They want their product to be the go-to app for feeling better when sad. In Hook model style, the developer wants the internal emotional trigger of feeling unhappy and discouraged to have the player launch the app in order to lift his spirits.</p>\n<p><b>What Could Be Better?</b></p>\n<p>There\u2019s no in-app way to show off what he owns such as balloons and notes. The player wishes other people could see his balloon with its decorations.

He wants to share happy moments with friends and family. His friends and family are likely a part of these moments and would be interested in what he shares. Sharing makes him feel good. The developer could incorporate Core Drive #5 by adding sharing functions.</p>\n<p>Also, if there was a social aspect where a friend can gift tickets to add fuel to your balloon, that would be a combination of Core Drive #5 with some urgency provided by Core Drive #8. This would be just like gifting in the <a href=\"http://www.mindbloom.com/lifegame\">Life Game by Mindbloom</a>,\u00a0where a friend can gift water and sunlight to your Life Game tree.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-6-scarcity-impatience/#.U0cFfK1dVUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Core Drive #6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience</a></h2>\n<p><b></b><b>Octalysis\u00a0</b>Score 3</p>\n<p>The small number of decoration options with the first balloon makes the player feel limited in what he can do with this initial balloon.

But as I have mentioned in my other posts, they can also be used to enhance and enrich educational experiences. These are called serious games.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The combination of learning and fun is a potent force in today\u2019s corporate world. To generate innovation and maintain competitive edge, organizations need to align themselves with market changes, both domestically and globally. As far as processes are concerned, this means that employees must adapt by continuously learning new skills and sharpening their abilities to solve problems- just doing the job in the same routine fashion doesn&#8217;t lead to the same growth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Traditional ways of teaching often mirror conventional classrooms. These include lectures with whiteboards, hand outs in the form of quizzes and surveys and instructional videos. Most people passively react to such formats. Participants may remember terms and information and they may be able to pass certain tests but this can offer a false sense of comfort as their ability to apply their new knowledge to actual, real-life problems remains untested.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Besides training team members, there is also the challenge of educating and training clients. Clients often need to have a deep level understanding of how a particular product works. If there are enormous technical complexities, the information can be particularly daunting and frustrating- not very good for maintaining a happy customer base.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And in addition to employees and clients, corporate decision-makers also need to maintain regular learning initiatives to understand the perspectives and preferences of their clients. And with these insights, they must continuously make decisions to develop their products so that they are relevant to the needs of their customers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">All these objectives require effective learning where information is quickly assimilated in order to be applied for the best possible results.\u00a0 Very little time can be afforded to make transitions from conceptual knowledge to astute action. This is where the power of games can make a huge difference.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are five companies (in no ranking order) who are dedicated to developing software and platforms that optimize learning experiences through game mechanics.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><!--more--></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://playgen.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>PlayGen</b></a></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Playgen-Logo.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4490 aligncenter\" alt=\"Playgen Logo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Playgen-Logo.png?resize=246%2C64&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"64\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Playgen-Logo.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Playgen-Logo.png?resize=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">PlayGen is a company whose products are based on the expertise of specialists across many different disciplines. Coders, technical innovators, creative designers, psychologists and strategists work together as a team to create customized games and simulations for their clients across many different sectors such as education, health and communications. They focus on influencing and driving targeted behaviors through their applications.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of their platforms is the COLLAGE project which is supported in part by the European Commission and their partners. Gamification principles are used to foster both learning and social creativity in the work environment.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://www.innovationgames.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Innovation Games</b></a></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Innovation-games-logo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4493 aligncenter\" alt=\"Innovation Games logo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Innovation-games-logo.jpg?resize=374%2C77&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"374\" height=\"77\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Innovation-games-logo.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Innovation-games-logo.jpg?resize=300%2C61&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Innovation Games focuses on innovation, which is pretty clear from their name. Innovation can mean a lot of different things. But it needs to be focused. What ultimately matters is being able to produce offerings that are highly relevant to real life market needs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Innovation Games has developed platforms to help companies make the best product development decisions. This includes:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Interactive visual collaboration games. Companies can play these with their clients to generate insights about what is truly desired.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Tools for the sales team to gather information about the needs of their clients and to prioritize them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Virtual market games to help the development team make reliable decisions about which features to build immediately and which ones to set aside for future iterations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/play-gen.jpg\"></a></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://www.caspianlearning.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Caspian Learning</b></a></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Caspian-Learning-Logo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4494 aligncenter\" alt=\"Caspian Learning Logo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Caspian-Learning-Logo.jpg?resize=350%2C61&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"350\" height=\"61\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Caspian-Learning-Logo.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Caspian-Learning-Logo.jpg?resize=300%2C52&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Much of Caspian Learning\u2019s work focuses on helping their clients create the best training experiences possible. \u00a0Again, games can help facilitate learning and retention. But going beyond basic assimilation and recall, they can also cultivate practical new skills and prepare team members for successfully tackling situational challenges.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Caspian is able to develop customized serious games and 3D simulations for organizations. They also offer more standardized solutions by licensing their software to their clients who would then be able to create their own games.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Cutting edge learning tools such as these can certainly take the boredom out of conventional training manuals and presentations.\u00a0 And perhaps even more importantly, they can also help organizations make faster progress in being able to deliver new offerings to their customers<b>.</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/caspian-learning.jpg\"></a></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b></b><a href=\"http://virtualheroes.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Virtual Heroes</b></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Virtual-Heroes-Logo.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-4495\" alt=\"Virtual Heroes Logo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Virtual-Heroes-Logo.png?resize=281%2C155&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"281\" height=\"155\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Virtual-Heroes-Logo.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Virtual-Heroes-Logo.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With \u201cPlay.

In these fields accurate decisions and fast action can often means the difference between life and death. Therefore, proper training is needed to cultivate true heroes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Due to the serious and often dangerous nature of these challenges, it is nearly impossible for new trainees to practice in real life contexts. 3D simulated environments offer a higher level of safety where novice personnel can practice essential skills without putting anyone at risk.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, in emergency room situations, patients are able to interact in simulated scenarios where they can learn from their mistakes without endangering actual patients. They can be trained to think quickly and make appropriate life saving decisions. These scenarios can be modified to present novel challenges that offer more opportunities to practice. Data can even be collected at the end based on the players\u2019 good and bad performance. This helps instructors know what to focus on in when designing their curriculum.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/virtual-heroes.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4045 aligncenter\" alt=\"virtual-heroes\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/virtual-heroes.jpg?resize=300%2C240&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/virtual-heroes.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/virtual-heroes.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://morfmedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Morf Media</b></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Morf-Media-Logo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4496\" alt=\"Morf Media Logo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Morf-Media-Logo.jpg?resize=200%2C61&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"200\" height=\"61\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Morf Media brings complex and dry information to life through enjoyable game mechanics (in full disclosure, I serve a member of their Board- so yeah, I&#8217;m a little biased).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many of their rich media applications are geared towards the educational and financial sectors.

Instead, it can be presented as immersive and interactive e-learning environments.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many people would describe their school experience as painfully boring. A teacher delivers lectures to us verbally. And white boards (or even occasional videos) help to provide the visuals we need. Students passively sit in their seats, mindlessly taking notes. And this is followed by reading and textbook assignments.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, research shows that most individuals need to understand the larger direction and the point of what they are learning in order to make sense of the details. This requires proactive involvement with the information. And in the real world, digesting information is not enough. We need to be able to apply it to create the results we want.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Studies have also shown that our nervous systems are wired to best interact and communicate through playful engagement. Therefore, gamifying learning experiences can lead to faster learning, innovation, and skill development. This enables ideas to transition into actual results within a much shorter range of time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do you have other examples of serious game platforms that are uniquely gamifying the corporate training and client education space?

However, if that were the case, students would feel extremely excited when there will be an exam, because that would be a new opportunity to feel developed and accomplished!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not the case. Students (even good students!) abhor tests and do it just because they have to. Very few people look forward to tests.</p>\n<p>If we successfully gamify education, then &#8220;assessments&#8221; will be seen as an exciting opportunity for students to unlock new materials and skill-sets instead of always being a drag.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

            "rendered": "<p>From the perspective of a conventional grown up, video games may be fun but they are a waste of time. They cause young men and women to sit on the couch for hours on end staring at a screen, completely immersed in another world devoid of all useful (i.e. productive) benefit. Players become addicted to these games while slovenly sliding into obesity, overall laziness, and unproductive lifestyles. They might even become aggressive and antisocial. Gasp!</p>\n<p>However, if you have been following this blog, you are probably well aware by now that there are many examples where games are being used for good and healthy purposes. Other game designers have noticed this as well: <a href=\"https://www.crazygames.com/blog/2019/01/10/Brain-Games-for-the-Elderly-Benefits-What-to-Play/\">brain games for the elderly may indeed have many benefits</a>. In general, for every negative in life, there is usually a positive, a silver lining so to speak. It may not be immediately obvious but if you dig around a bit and look at it from a different perspective, the benefits can usually be found.</p>\n<p>Although video games are a form of self indulgence, they often provide unique and engaging environments that train players to think fast and resourcefully. With the right design and mechanics, they can facilitate learning and tap into diverse levels of cognitive thinking and problem-solving in ways that are not as easy to achieve with books and other forms of media. Research has recently come out investigating the positive potential of video games to better harness our cognitive capabilities to shape the brain in new and powerful ways.</p>\n<h3>Exploring New Ways to Harness Video Games</h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/OOsqkQytHOs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.news.wisc.edu/21548\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Nature</em> published an article</a> by two researchers, Daphne Bavelier of the University of Rochester and Richard Davidson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who were exploring new possibilities within game development to improve mental functioning, learning and to even strengthen emotional intelligence.</p>\n<p>Their work was welcomed with open arms- Bavelier and Davidson even led a meeting at the White House\u00a0attended by entertainment media experts and neuroscientists to discuss applications in interactive technology to better understand brain functioning and to enhance the overall well being of individuals, young and old alike.</p>\n<p>Within the <em>Nature</em>\u00a0article, they implored game designers and neuroscientists to develop new types of games that would improve overall psychological health. They specifically were keen to focus on these areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Behavior</li>\n<li>Lowered anxiety</li>\n<li>Heightened attention</li>\n<li>Empathy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While game enthusiasts and proponents of gamification believe in the power of well designed applications to do extraordinary things (e.g. enhance enterprise efficiency and creative learning for kids; garner tangible support for charity causes; and even help rescue teams with natural disaster rescue efforts), it is exciting to see that the scientific research community is also embracing the idea of redefining society&#8217;s negative perceptions of games by advancing innovative design. In doing so, they are coming up with some interesting results on the ability of games to increase intelligence (within specific areas). Here are a few examples:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><b>Neuro Racer Shows Cognitive Enhancement In Older Individuals</b></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/PbsGtFgEgdk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>A research team led by Adam Gazzaley at the University of San Francisco designed a game called <a href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2013/09/108616/training-older-brain-3-d-video-game-enhances-cognitive-control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neuro Racer</a> and tested to see if it positively affected the attention, reaction, and cognitive functions of 40 subjects aged 60-85.</p>\n<p>Players were told to drive a car along a road track. They were required to respond to specific sign posts by pressing a button while attempting to simultaneously filter out other signs. The game becomes more challenging as the players master levels.</p>\n<p>The participants engaged in a month-long training period which required twelve hours of playing the game.</p>\n<p>The experiment showed that older adult brains are more malleable and adaptive than previously thought- the subjects\u00a0were able to perform as well as players in their twenties who had no previous exposure to Neuro Racer.</p>\n<p>They also outperformed the control group on attention and working memory tasks. Normally, these areas of functioning decline with age. And even EEG scans showed more activity in the prefrontal cortex across the participant pool.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s exciting about these results is that Neuro Racer may be a prototype in a new generation of games that will be prescribed by doctors to help improve brain functioning in patients.</p>\n<h3><b>Real Time Strategy Games May Improve Cognitive Flexibility</b></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Big-Bang-Theory-Struggling-playing-Video-Games.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4380 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Big-Bang-Theory-Struggling-playing-Video-Games.jpg?resize=300%2C150&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Four actors in the Big Bang Theory are Playing Video Games\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Big-Bang-Theory-Struggling-playing-Video-Games.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Big-Bang-Theory-Struggling-playing-Video-Games.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Led by Dr. Brian Glass, researchers at the Queen Mary University of London and the University College of London <a href=\"http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/se/112578.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studied the effects of real time strategy games on problem solving capabilities</a>. The researchers were particularly interested in measuring dimensions of cognitive flexibility which they defined as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the ability to adapt and mentally &#8220;switch gears&#8221; to new tasks</li>\n<li>the ability to process many different and alternative ideas to solve problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In today\u2019s economy, problem solvers are more valued than ever before, which makes research on cognitive flexibility particularly important.</p>\n<p>Their experiment involved 72 subjects who were divided into three groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group 1 played an easy version of Star Craft</li>\n<li>Group 2 played a more complex version of Star Craft</li>\n<li>Group 3 played the Sims, which required little to no demand on memory or tactical thought processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All participants played for 40 hours throughout 6-8 weeks. The subjects who played Star Craft displayed afterwards much greater speed and mental agility compared to those who played the Sims. And these effects were enhanced for the group who played the harder version of Star Craft.</p>\n<p>Researchers again assert that the brain is flexible, not fixed. And it can become sharper through games. Soon, we may be seeing games being prescribed for clinical treatments of ADHD or even brain injuries.</p>\n<h3><b>Specific Game Types Enhance Different Mental Skills</b></h3>\n<p>The idea of games enhancing mental prowess is somewhat vague. Cognition after all spans many types of capabilities.</p>\n<p>An experiment led by Adam Chie-Ming Oei and Michael Donald Patterson at the Nanyang Technical University of Singapore <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130313182142.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studied different types of games and their positive impacts on different types of cognitive skills.</a></p>\n<p>This study involved participants who were required to play an assigned game for an hour a day, five days a week for an entire month. There were three types of games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Life simulations (e.g. Sims)</li>\n<li>Object matching games (e.g. Bejeweled)</li>\n<li>Action games/finding hidden objects (e.g. Hidden Expedition)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the experiment, the subjects showed improved performance on cognitive skills tasks as a result of these game exercises. The researchers were able to identify the skills that improved within each of the game categories they studied.</p>\n<p>Visual search skills were sharpened through games that required matching and spatial memory capabilities. The ability to track multiple objects improved via action games.</p>\n<h3>The Importance of Game Design</h3>\n<p>Although we are now seeing more studies which illustrate better performance on certain types of cognitive tasks, the answer to the question of whether or not video games can make you smarter depends on how intelligence is defined. While games can certainly sharpen specific types of skills, what matters is whether or not these abilities are transferred to real life contexts in ways that matter. And this in turn depends on how well the game is designed to achieve this.</p>\n<p>This goes back to our understanding that it&#8217;s not the game and its mechanics themselves that matter, it&#8217;s how it&#8217;s\u00a0<em>designed</em> to function and the outcomes it is designed to achieve. We will see games and their designers working to better tap into our Core Drives and elicit generative functions in both cognitive and emotional intelligence.

But what is not common knowledge is that nearly half the world\u2019s population is at risk for contracting the disease. Every year, over a million individuals die from it and seventy percent of these fatalities are children. What may also surprise you is that malaria vaccines don\u2019t yet exist. However, the tragic deaths associated with this disease can be simply prevented by sleeping under a $3 mosquito net!</p>\n<p>Malaria is prevalent in areas that are warm and damp. These conditions are ideal for mosquitoes to thrive and are found in places around the world- specifically Sub Saharan Africa, India and southern Asia. Malaria is considered to be a minimal threat in North America (case in point: mosquito nets are sold by chains like Cost Plus World Market as bedroom decorations rather than for protection).</p>\n<p>Simply lecturing about the facts and statistics of malaria may not be enough to garner effective action but vivid and immersive experiences may change how we understand and take action on this epidemic.</p>\n<p>As an example of social gamification at work, the Emmy Award winning animation studio, <a href=\"http://www.psyop.tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PsyOp </a>partnered with <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> to develop a free mobile app called Nightmare: Malaria to spread awareness on this issue and raise funds for life saving mosquito nets.</p>\n<p>Released this past December, Psyop is banking on their game to generate enough enthusiasm to secure millions of nets for at-risk individuals across the globe. And with enough participation, it may succeed at lowering the death toll significantly by the end of 2014 and beyond. Here&#8217;s how they&#8217;ve designed the game to be both engaging and informative:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><b>The Basics of Malaria</b></h3>\n<p>The graphics of Nightmare Malaria has a story book appeal which is visually striking and reminiscent of \u00a0the game, <a href=\"http://limbogame.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Limbo</a>. Through a stylistic narrative, the game also brings information about the disease to life. To appreciate the creativity behind all this, let&#8217;s familiarize ourselves with the basics of malaria:</p>\n<p>Malaria is a disease that is caused by the Plasmodium protozoan. This micro-organism is transmitted through the saliva of the female Anopheles mosquito. When the mosquito injects its needle like proboscis into the skin to suck blood, the protozoan is able to enter the victim\u2019s circulatory system (not the most pleasant image, I know).</p>\n<p>It then travels to various organs in the body such as the liver, kidneys and brain. The initial symptoms are very general and difficult to diagnose. Afflicted individuals will first start to experience dizziness, drowsiness, irritability and the inability to sleep. As the protozoan reproduces, victims suffer from headaches, convulsions and fevers. Without proper treatment, coma and death can result.</p>\n<h3><b>The Story of Malaria as Told By Psyop</b></h3>\n<p>The fact that malaria could be the subject of an artful, imaginative and immersive game would probably not occur to most of us. But Psyop certainly shows us how a nasty disease can be fascinatingly taught to a wider audience while generating solutions in the process.</p>\n<p>At the beginning part of the game, Susan Sarandon narrates a poignant, dark and dramatic poem about the disease</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>The evil King Malaria fed</em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>His parasites then began to spread</em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Through the cells and to the liver</em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Her blood then becomes a deadly river</em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>The fever, convulsions and vicious sickness</em></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Her end approaches with stunning quickness</em></p>\n<p>The main character of Nightmare: Malaria is a little girl who represents the children who die annually from the disease. In the opening scene, she is happy and secure within her sweet innocent world as she is tucked into bed. She dozes off and enters a blissful, candy colored dream scape. But all of this comes to an end after she is bitten by a mosquito and enters the dark, nightmarish world of her own body.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/nightmare-malaria.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-4312 aligncenter\" alt=\"nightmare-malaria\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/nightmare-malaria.jpg?resize=364%2C282&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"364\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/nightmare-malaria.jpg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/nightmare-malaria.jpg?w=419&amp;ssl=1 419w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><b></b></p>\n<h3><b>Playing Nightmare: Malaria</b></h3>\n<p>The game consists of eighteen levels. Beginners must help the little girl overcome obstacles through the watery world of her circulatory system. Navigation controls allow her to run or walk forwards or backwards. Along the way, players help the little girl jump and collect teddy bears.</p>\n<p>She is challenged to climb over heaps of blood cells and avoid meeting her doom by falling into green abysmal pools of pus (yup, another vivid image)</p>\n<p>And she must also dodge mosquitoes in order to survive. At times, mosquito nets are presented to help shelter the little girl.</p>\n<p>The controls are deliberately inaccurate to create the sense of struggle. And it is not easy to avoid the pitfalls. Upon death, the player is shown reminders to donate $3 to provide a net to help prevent malaria.</p>\n<p>After successfully navigating her blood stream, the little girl is allowed to roam through the passages of her brain.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/mMggEr2gCgM\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><b>How Nightmare: Malaria Was Developed</b></h3>\n<p>Psyop recently created a game division at their production studio. Nightmare: Malaria was their first project which was intended to help a non-profit organization called T<a href=\"http://greatergood.tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">he Establishment for the Greater Good</a>, which partnered with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>. According to co-founder, Ave Carillo, this decision to partner with these organizations would \u201csave the most lives with the least amount of money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Psyop brought on a team of interns to develop the malaria awareness project for EEG who would not otherwise have the means to commission this type of project.</p>\n<p>Originally the focus of their efforts was to provide the animation content but they naturally moved on to integrate the dynamic illustrated story with game mechanics in order to enrich the engagement level that viewers had with the story.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uFyrmcj7Vd4\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><b>Games and Proactive Aid</b></h3>\n<p>Most of us wish we could do more to help eliminate much of the suffering across the world. Awareness of issues is often not enough to truly elicit concrete actions. But with the help of gamification, it is possible to integrate contribution as a natural part of the player\u2019s experience. In my blog we\u2019ve seen this with MMORPG\u2019s and disaster relief, and the empowerment of women in developing nations. And now with Nightmare: Malaria, we see how a stylistic, immersive narrative can be employed to save lives from a preventable disease.</p>\n<p>Instead of feeling powerless, we now live in a time where we can have fun for good, and make a real difference in the process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

And because of that, they have people hooked.</p>\n<p>Arguably, Flappy Bird is the latest sensation to attain massive viral phenomena. According to its creator, Dong Nguyen, <i>&#8220;I didn\u2019t use any promotion methods. All accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram about Flappy Bird are not mine. The popularity could be my luck.&#8221;</i></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/117692489@N03/12637199093/in/photolist-kfGX1Z-jWkjjH-jTDS2J-jWjnVT-jWki8L-k2UFwP-jVZN89-jXYfDD-k2L95p-jQd5hr-jVX9cU-jRFtLE-jVTrzB-jY6YMb-jWpPFw-k2K4U4-jY3rrw-k4GGE1-k1cUbT-jW4YEx-k1cSy5-k2N3St-jWojPr-k1aMYt-k6kGot-jWoVKB-k1a3TF-jWhg1M-jWpgbm-jYAEeH-jY9Nxr-k1uF4h-jWgVd8-jVXgbe-jVRTeZ-k2ZpGT-k19Ct7-k1dy9t-jYcbHp-k4xJLK-jRDd9c-k1pHdN-jPFRCi-jY81av-k1bnx1-jVVHtD-k2HJ7R-k3bssi-jRGMux-jXUJNx-k15prc/player/\" height=\"394\" width=\"500\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the game surpassed 50 million downloads and generated over 47,000 reviews within the App Store. Although it is free, the app generates over $50,000 a day from ad revenue.</p>\n<p>But ironically, the overwhelming popularity of Flappy Bird resulted in its demise.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The app&#8217;s creator had had enough. Nguyen, tweeted, \u00a0<em>\u201cI can call Flappy Bird a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it,</em>\u201d Nguyen also wrote, \u201c<em>I am sorry Flappy Bird users, 22 hours from now, I will take Flappy Bird down. I cannot take this anymore.</em>\u201d The app was taken down on February 9th.</p>\n<p>This did not sit well.</p>\n<p>One distraught Flappy Bird fan, anonymously named DS, even petitioned the White House to bring the game back. The person wrote,<em>\u00a0\u201cEvery time I lose, my eyes burn like a thousand suns but I&#8217;m happy that I can feel such tremendous emotion.\u00a0I want everyone to be able to experience such emotional magnitude.\u00a0Bring the power back to the people.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>One ambitious fan tried selling their iPhone with the original Flappy Bird app on Ebay for $99,900 (the auction was taken down since Ebay doesn&#8217;t allow the sale of smart phones with the original owner&#8217;s apps still on them).</p>\n<h3><b>Why Is Flappy Bird So Addicting?</b></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/85676061\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/85676061\">What is Flappy Bird?</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/prestonhartley\">Preston Hartley</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>Many game designers put a lot of aesthetic considerations into the look and feel of the experience they are creating. This is obviously not the case with Flappy Bird.</p>\n<p>Its appeal is tied to other factors.</p>\n<p>The game play is very simple.\u00a0Flappy Bird is a heavy animal with small wings that struggles to fly through a series of vertical pipes. The player must use touch screen taps to keep him flying.</p>\n<p>You have to navigate the little bird through gaps between the pipes. Flappy Bird must successfully fly through each gap without hitting any part of the structures. The player earns a point each time they pass an obstruction.</p>\n<p>Here is why such a simple game design has people absolutely hooked: Visually, the gaps appear quite large. Therefore, it is easy to be deceived into thinking that passing through them should be easy enough. But the reality is quite different.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/FMQSLT7e9Q8\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Flappy Bird is not very agile and often hits his head against the top part of each opening. Every time he falls and dies, players can&#8217;t help but feel frustrated at having been defeated by what seems like such an easy game. They keep trying over and over and over again to beat their previous scores.</p>\n<p>This quote from a reviewer sums up the experience: &#8220;this game really pisses me off, but I have to keep playing it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Enough said.</p>\n<h3><b>The Octalysis Core Drives of Flappy Bird</b></h3>\n<p>The mechanisms that keep people playing can be more precisely explained through identifying the core drives that are triggered during the game.</p>\n<p>As with any game, there is an Onboarding phase. Players start by becoming familiar with that game&#8217;s physics by navigating Flappy bird through tapping their screen. Players immediately understand that the objective is to get through the openings in the pipes but when they actually attempt to pass, more likely than not, they will fail, and fail hard.</p>\n<p>Right away, the Onboarding phase of Flappy Bird teaches players that the game is fueled by frustration. This is a very unique form of Onboarding, which is normally supposed to teach players the purpose and basic mechanics of the game as easily and painlessly as possible so that they can feel encouraged to keep playing.</p>\n<p>If the Flappy Bird developer made it easy to pass through the pipes, the game would be quite boring. Players would probably assume that they indeed are playing a game meant for five year olds and quit to look for something else to play.</p>\n<p>But instead they are shocked that they can\u2019t make it through the large gap in the pipes. And so they keep on playing until they actually experience more wins to beat what they feel are embarrassingly low scores. Talk about <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black Hat Gamification</a>!</p>\n<h3><b>Scarcity and Impatience</b></h3>\n<p>Flappy Bird is fueled almost exclusively by Core Drive 6 (Scarcity and Impatience). Points are tantalizingly hard to come by. In fact there are players who are proud that they got as high as six points.</p>\n<h3><b>Development and Accomplishment</b></h3>\n<p>The impatience and frustration that people feel when they lose leads them to keep striving for actual wins. They are compelled by Core Drive 2 (Development and Accomplishment). As they develop finesse with the mechanics and get better at navigating the bird, they start to feel a stronger sense of accomplishment in realizing the attainment of higher scores.</p>\n<p>Feeling this sense of accomplishment, players are driven to share their scores on sites like Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n<h3><b>Social Influence and Relatedness</b></h3>\n<p>Those who have kept playing and managed to get better may boast scores within the range of a few hundred. One person even tweeted an image documenting a legendary milestone of 12,201 points! But this of course, is a very extreme case (see the youtube video above if you don&#8217;t believe me).</p>\n<p>Whether the sharing occurs on Twitter, online comment fields or in private (offline) discussions amongst friends, it is actually quite natural for individuals to want to talk about their frustrations as well as their scores.</p>\n<p>Core Drive 5 (Social influence and Relatedness) socially reinforces the desire to strive for a higher number of points. When people play alone, they only have themselves to compete with but because the Onboarding process is very simple and short, players can compete with many others in their friend network. Who doesn&#8217;t want to compete when the barrier to entry is so low yet the points are so hard to obtain?</p>\n<p>Although the original Flappy Bird has been taken down, there is no shortage of copy cat games for the thrill to live on.</p>\n<p>Do any of you feel driven to beat 12,201?</p>\n<p>As always, please share your feedback and comments below.</p>\n",

But the gaming field also includes sports, card games, and board games and the old paradigm that games only serve as fun and recreation is radically changing. In <i>Gamification Revolution</i>, we explore this shift in culture and see how business leaders are now using games to their advantage.</p>\n<p>The authors start us off by presenting a quote by Theodore Roosevelt that captures the old paradigm, \u201cWhen you play, play hard: when you work, don\u2019t play at all.\u201d This has been the conventional attitude that has defined what it means to have a sound work ethic.</p>\n<p>As games evolved and entered the corporate arena, the lines between work and play are increasingly becoming blurred. The emergence of technology, greater market competition and the need for organizations to grow and adapt has created the need for better mechanisms to accelerate learning and performance within companies. At the same time, these factors have also required that organization&#8217;s relate with their customers more consistently and authentically in order to gain quality insight on developing winning products and services. Games now serve as an \u201cinvaluable change agent\u201d for corporations to meet these demands.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qsSkN7saXCM\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><br />\nGabe Zichermann on the Gamification Revolution (GSummit SF 2013)</p>\n<p>The book cites a few interesting stats which illustrate the phenomenon of gamification as an actual revolution.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gartner Group, which is an IT research and advisory company, predicts that by the year 2015, 70% of the biggest enterprises in the world will be relying on gamification. And 50% of of all innovation will be the result of playing games.</li>\n<li>M2 research has projected that $3 billion will be the annual spend devoted to gamification services and technology before 2020.</li>\n<li>The amount of time consumers spend playing video games has doubled from the years 2002-2012. Average Facebook users spend $50 per year playing games on the site.\u00a0 Research has also noted that people are now spending less time on traditional forms of leisure and entertainment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People have a natural proclivity towards playing games. The progress of technology and gamification applications has made it possible to develop an even greater number of highly enjoyable games which has generated the increased amount of time that individuals spend on them. Therefore, the investments that companies are making on integrating game mechanics within their own company strategies are aptly aligned with this trend.</p>\n<h3><b>Companies Who Are Using Games</b></h3>\n<p><i>Gamification Revolution</i> lists several common company objectives that games can help address and achieve.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving performance of team members</li>\n<li>Training and the acquisition of new information and skills</li>\n<li>Energizing employees through wellness and health initiatives</li>\n<li>Harnessing and leveraging the insight of consumers</li>\n<li>Engaging customers as part of a long term relationship development strategy</li>\n<li>Innovating through the collective insights of crowd sourcing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Examples of\u00a0 actual companies mentioned in the book who use games for such purposes include: Nike, SAP, Pearson, Salesforce, McDonalds, Cisco, United Airlines, Microsoft, Spotify, Target, Siemens, GE, IBM and United Airlines.</p>\n<p><b>Engagement As the Pivotal Factor of Business Success</b></p>\n<p><i>Gamification Revolution</i> identifies engagement between management, employees and business strategies as a critical but overlooked element for the success of organizations. Enterprise software development is given as an example. According to the 2011 CHAOS report of the Standish Group, 21% of these project initiatives fail due to poor levels of engagement.</p>\n<p>Effective communication in today\u2019s business landscape is no longer from a top down approach. According to <i>Gamification Revolution</i>, \u201cold models of engagement will not scale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Employees need to be proactively involved in their learning and skills development. Sitting passively while trying to absorb information through lectures does very little to enhance their actual performance.</p>\n<p>And by dictating marketing messages to customers, there is no way to really know what they think and feel about a brand\u2019s offerings. This insight is important for understanding how to grow, involve and improve in order to boost revenue.</p>\n<p>Secondly, while upper management may be keenly aware of the need to communicate effectively with employees and customers, it can be challenging to capture and sustain the attention of both groups.</p>\n<p>The average person is constantly bombarded with many distractions. And even if their attention is caught for a brief moment, it is difficult to sustain it.\u00a0 According to Chao Liu, a Microsoft Research Fellow, it only takes a new website visitor to decide within ten seconds or less whether or not they want to stay and keep browsing. And even if they stay longer than 30 seconds, the site may only capture two minutes of their attention (kudos for getting this far in the post).</p>\n<p>With regards to mobile apps, Localytics found that 69% of users will only access an app ten times or less. And according to Flurry Analytics, only 25% of users will return to an app within a three month time period.</p>\n<p>Well designed games offer strong and positive reinforcement that can be sustainably felt. The experience of increasing levels of achievement and awesomeness is what drives desired behavior on an ongoing basis (think <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/#.UvOuhPa8F8I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Octalysis Core Drives</a>). Although there are many options for encouraging engagement, this type of dynamic is why the integration of games in external and internal efforts is a smart choice for organizations.</p>\n<p><b>Rewards As a Driver of Player Engagement</b></p>\n<p>In order to motivate a particular behavior, it needs to be rewarded. Within the context of gamification, there are different models which explain the relationship between game mechanics and the rewards. Effective decisions in design should result in highly motivated players who want to keep playing. Readers of this blog, would know of course, that <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/#.UvOuhPa8F8I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Octalysis</a> is one such model, which is based on eight intrinsic core drives of game players.</p>\n<p><i>Gamification Revolution</i> describes the ability to earn status as a key drive. They cite the Whitehall Study to support this.\u00a0 According to this research on 10,000 employees of the British Civil Service, individuals who had higher status actually lived longer than those of lower status. This was a stronger predictor of health compared to diet, smoking and fitness.</p>\n<p>Therefore, rewards such as points, leaderboards, rewards, badges and levels can be powerful motivators that promote, what the book refers to as Eustress (positive stress), which motivates players to achieve more.</p>\n<p>Corporations who intend to implement game mechanics internally or in engaging with their customers may choose to use points and earned status as part of their strategy. Or they can also choose to provide a more immersive experience based on a comprehensive combination of core drive mechanics. Therefore, thoughtful decisions should be made when choosing which route to take. Games are not a quick fix to instantly boost company performance. The success of a game initiative is ultimately contingent on how motivated the participants are to keep playing.</p>\n<p>Therefore, appropriate decisions should be based on prioritizing the needs of the players instead of making hasty irreverent decisions on game design.</p>\n<p>In summary, check out <i>Gamification Revolution: How Leaders Leverage Game Mechanics To Crush the Competition</i> by Gabe Zichermann and Joselin Linder to better understand how games are revolutionizing business thinking and practices.</p>\n",

The question of whether or not video games cause violence is certainly controversial and its fierce debate particularly\u00a0arises in the aftermath of school shootings and mass murders. Naturally, people seek reasons to explain why these events occur and look for ways our society can stop them from happening again. \u00a0What fuels these debates is that In many cases, investigations reveal that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes spent enormous amounts of time playing violent video games.</p>\n<p>For some, it is clear that video game violence contributed to these tragedies. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/science/studying-the-effects-of-playing-violent-video-games.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2&amp;ref=science\" target=\"_blank\">Yet research shows</a> that the incidence of youth violence in particular, is at an all time low, falling by half between 1994 and 2010 while video game sales have more than doubled in this since 1996.</p>\n<p>Some politicians are convinced that pervasive violence in video games contribute to real acts of violence. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/tax-reform-plan-violent-video-game-makers-2014-2\" target=\"_blank\">Business Insider reported on a tax</a> reform presented by the House GOP which sought to prevent creators of violent video games from receiving an R&amp;D tax credit for research and experimentation.</p>\n<p>Last year, the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Obama administration sought to develop a $10 million research program</a> to investigate the relationship between video game content and actual violence (it did not come to fruition thanks to low public interest around gun control measures).</p>\n<p>Despite the strong anti-violent video game rhetoric and biases of the federal government, the Supreme Court ruled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Entertainment_Merchants_Association\" target=\"_blank\">(in Brown vs. Entertainment Merchants, 2011)</a> that video game content is protected under the First Amendment and can\u2019t be regulated by government. The Court also dismissed psychology research as unpersuasive as some studies seem to support a causal relationship between violence in video games and aggressive behavior in real life while others support no clear link.</p>\n<p>In an age when violence in video games is more vivid and graphic than ever before, it is natural for parents and educators to question if their kids and young adults should be left to play and watch what they want.</p>\n<p>Peer-reviewed research is looked to as a source of objective truth but, as it stands now, the findings have not pointed to any clear answers. Though lack of clarity continues to dominate the debate, here are a few notable studies that can help guide your own thinking on this issue.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><b>Research Supporting a Connection between Video Games and Violence</b></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/J0msXmJLfpM\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2013/03/26/violentvideogames\" target=\"_blank\">A study at Iowa State University</a> was published in the 2013 issue of Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice. Researchers examined 227 young offenders in Pennsylvania. Most of them were guilty of committing an average of nine \u201cserious acts of violence.\u201d This included gang fights or assaults on people. According to the study\u2019s analysis, each research participant shared the same high frequency affinity for playing violent video games.</p>\n<p>Many psychologists agree that these particular results do not illustrate that violent video games constitute a singular and leading cause for aggression as there are many other contributing variables that must be examined as well such as: social isolation, mental disorder, domestic issues, etc. However, the psychologists maintain that violent media is still a significant contributor, if not the smallest, or the largest factor.</p>\n<p>Another 2013 study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science showed that teens who played violent video games demonstrated lower levels of self control. 172 Italian high school students between 13-19 took part in the study. One group was given non-violent games to play such as Pinball 3D or MiniGolf 3D. \u00a0The other played Grand Theft Auto III or Grant Theft Auto: San Andreas.</p>\n<p>Self control was monitored in three scenarios.</p>\n<p>(1) While the subjects played, they were given a bowl of chocolate along with the instruction that they should not eat too much within a short period of time.</p>\n<p>(2) The participants were also told that the winner of a two-player game was allowed to blast the loser with a loud megaphone.</p>\n<p>(3) The students were also given a logic test. For every correct answer they would win a raffle ticket to exchange for prizes. They were then trusted to take the correct number of tickets from an envelope.</p>\n<p>The participants who played the violent games ate more chocolate, blasted their opponents much louder and more aggressively with the megaphone, and took more tickets than they were supposed to than those participants in the non-violent control group (both groups had the element of competition meaning that the competitive drive was factored in the research).</p>\n<p>The researchers also measured the subjects and their level of moral disengagement. They found that the players who tested high for this variable were more likely to be affected by violent video games and demonstrate dishonest and aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p><b></b><b>Research Disproving a Connection between Video Game Violence and Aggression</b></p>\n<p>A study conducted by Cheryl Olson \u00a0and Christopher Ferguson (Stetson University) observed the effect of violent video games on 377 American thirteen year olds who were clinically diagnosed with ADHD or depression. The assumptive premise was that these conditions would predispose these kids towards violent behavior. The researchers allowed the subjects to play video games with violent themes. Their results showed that the games actually had a slight calming, cathartic effect, lowering the group&#8217;s aggression and anti-social bullying behavior in some participants.</p>\n<p>According to a Brock University study, researchers found that competition, as opposed to violent themes, contributed more significantly to increases in aggression when they tested one group of subjects with another by having them the former participants play a violent game while the latter group played a non-violent game.\u00a0When the researchers compared games they found that higher levels of observed aggressive behavior were attributed to higher levels of competitiveness (as determined by the video games mechanics and design).</p>\n<p><b></b><b>So which is it? Do Violent Video Games Make us More Aggressive?</b></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/aHOxljUI4iE\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>One of the major challenges in trying to answer this question is in ruling out standard biases and narrowing study parameters. When, how, and for whom do violent video games have the most negative effect and can this be attributed by other variables beyond media? According to psychologist Romeo Vitelli, many research studies have been conducted with biased premises and search parameters. Problematic factors include:</p>\n<p>(1) Not knowing how to officially measure violence and aggression, due to a lack of commonly accepted tests which measure these social traits and effects.</p>\n<p>(2) Biases in publication, where positive results tend to be published more so than research outcomes which support negative results.</p>\n<p>(3) The concept of statistically significant differences. 0.15 is\u00a0 considered to be a statistically significant measure but it is still a small difference that may not warrant an official conclusion that should be widely generalized to larger populations.</p>\n<p>(4) Sponsorship. Studies commissioned by the video game industry as well as research commissioned by anti-violence groups are likely to be biased in terms of the conclusions that emerge.</p>\n<p>These issues continue to complicate research and policy discussions. We may even being targeting the wrong issue.</p>\n<p>It may be that heinous video game content by itself does not lead to higher aggression but instead draws players that already have higher proclivity towards actual violence. Therefore, as regulators attempt to address social morality and ethics by targeting a lightning rod industry like video games, the\u00a0prohibition of such games may cause these types of individuals to seek other types of outlets.</p>\n<p>It is clear that research has not conclusively answered the question of whether or not violent video games are harmful to society. Vitelli&#8217;s view on this is that \u00a0\u201cthe lack of a clear answer after decades of research suggest that the real problem may lie with our not being able to answer the right question.\u201d</p>\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, my personal opinion on the subject is that violence in video games is like violence in movies- it is all about context.</p>\n<p>Just because you see or in, some sense, embody evil characters in movies, games, or books does not mean you are naturally inclined to that type of personality. It&#8217;s about how you make sense of the violence and how you relate to its impact yourself. As powerful as games can be, I don&#8217;t think they can force you into being someone you are not.</p>\n<p>I would recommend that parents spend time with their children playing their favorite games. This will give parents the opportunity to clarify right from wrong, and provide their children with the right education and context. This will help children balance what they see and do in games and in life. Ultimately, parents can be the best guides in helping their kids understand all the information and experiences they will have growing up. Video games, like the playground, school, church, and restaurants are just one more venue to share this wisdom and experience.</p>\n<p>While the debate rages and the research remains indeterminate as whole, I would love to hear your own thoughts on the effects of violence in video games on social behavior in the comment field below.</p>\n",

Their are countless tragic stories of abuse, intolerance, oppression, and suffering that because of their diminished voice go unnoticed by the rest of the world. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.halftheskymovement.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Half the Sky Movement</span></a></span> is a transmedia initiative that was created to shed light on the struggles of mothers, young girls and their families in countries like Cambodia, Kenya, India, Sierra Leone, and Afghanistan. The project has received the support of celebrities like Diana Lane, America Ferrara and Olivia Wilde. What makes this initiative so appealing and powerful is how it combines different forms of media to share stories, raise awareness, and find solutions to a host of serious gender-based injustices.</p>\n<h3><b>Why the Half the Sky Movement Exists<br />\n</b></h3>\n<p>Women in many parts of the world face specific abuse and crimes that continue to impact the daily lives of them and their children. In some of the countries mentioned previously, women often do not have equitable opportunities for real education nor security in a stable economic future- Women perform two thirds of the world\u2019s total working hours but only earn 10% of wages. Statistics on school dropout rates are also dismal (according to Half the Sky, 1 out of every 5 primary school-age girls around the globe are not in school) This ultimately contributes to a cycle of illiteracy and poor career opportunities.</p>\n<p>Without access to proper medical care, women often face a high risk of dying from complications related to pregnancy. Women are also victims to severe gender-based crimes such as rape and other forms of social, mental, and physical abuse. The exploitation of women as prostitutes by sex trafficking rings continues to be a growing global problem and in many cases, the laws in their countries fail to protect them from harm and often work against their interests.</p>\n<p>Without resources and opportunities to change their own circumstances, the direct and indirect oppression of women continues to be a systematic and cyclical gross injustice.</p>\n<p>To combat this and transform lives, The Half the Sky Movement aims to cut &#8220;&#8230; across platforms to ignite the change needed to put an end to the oppression of women and girls worldwide, the defining issue of our time (<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.halftheskymovement.org/pages/movement\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Half the Sky Movement</span></a></span>).&#8221;</p>\n<p>So how do they do this?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/MRfDzznfEOU\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>The Half the Sky Movement combines several media platforms that shape public discourse and action on these issues. They&#8217;ve published a book, a PBS television series, a website and blog, a film, and several Facebook and mobile games.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.halftheskymovement.org/pages/mobile-games\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Their three mobile games</span></a></span> educate children and young adults in developing nations about important health and social issues. These include specific lessons such as getting rid of intestinal worms, managing a successful and healthy pregnancy, and important information on larger social issues such as education, gender-equality, and marriage.</p>\n<p>While the core elements of these games are focused on providing support to women and children, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HalftheGame\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Facebook game</span></a> (supported by organizations such as the Ford Foundation, Zynga.org and Intel) is intended to raise money and resources to empower women.</p>\n<h3><b>How The Half the Sky Game Makes A Difference</b></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/0Nd6OVrYnZc\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The interactive story of the Half the Sky game on Facebook features a young married woman in India with two children named Radhika. Players help her make choices that will enable her to earn the money she needs to improve the quality of life for herself and her family across diverse areas such as health, education and economic opportunities.</p>\n<p>In a number of progressive scenarios throughout the game, Radhika will need to choose between taking a proactive approach to solve a dilemma, or not speaking up and taking a more subtle route instead. Players are able to elevate their rankings and secure different titles for the character such as activist, advocate and leader.</p>\n<p>Besides helping Radhika navigate different social situations, there are also fun mini-games that keep the player interested and involved in her life. These are simple games that require basic strategic thinking which ensures that users receive regular gratification.</p>\n<p>The game also features currencies that allow players to obtain special boosts. These include more time to complete games, and mega-linking abilities, and score boosters which garner more points and therefore higher status (for Radhika and you).</p>\n<p>As Radhika accomplishes different objectives and secures more opportunities for herself, she is able to expand the scope of her journey while meeting new people in Kenya, Afghanistan, Vietnam and the United States- which is the game&#8217;s final destination.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, at any point in the game, players are able to make direct donations to support the movement. The gameplay reinforces this action by connecting fun objectives with parallels in the real lives of women and children across the world. Let&#8217;s explore this further.</p>\n<h3><b>What Makes the Half the Sky Facebook Game so Unique<br />\n</b></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/half-the-sky.jpg\"></a>While other non-profit causes have developed games to help raise funding, Half the Sky <em>uniquely allows players to unlock and contribute actual donations (in the form of goods) that are related to the content of the story.</em> This is much like the idea of buying a pair of Tom\u2019s shoes where every purchase secures a new pair of shoes for a child in need.</p>\n<p>The concept of contributing tangible goods has a stronger appeal for many people as opposed to monetary funds which can go towards more nebulous areas like administrative costs.</p>\n<p>Books are one example within the Half the Sky game. As a player completes a mission, he or she is able to unlock a book as a prize that will actually be donated to a person in need. Through collaborative partnerships, the book is donated by the Pearson Foundation and is distributed by the organization, <i>Room to Read</i>.</p>\n<p>Another example of this unique game-prize-to-real-donation can be seen with goats. Within the story, if you buy a goat to help start an income generating business, <a href=\"http://www.heifer.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Heiffer International</span></a> will actually donate a real goat to a real family. This organization is dedicated to providing livestock, trees and seeds to needy recipients around the world.</p>\n<p><b>Games for Change</b></p>\n<p>All of us distinctly know the feeling of helplessness when we are shown images of suffering from those we cannot reach. One of the great things about gamification is the ability to create systems that enable participants to engage in actions that lead to positive change more consistently and at larger scales.</p>\n<p>Half the Sky is the first executive produced game by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesforchange.org%2F&amp;ei=-U3TUs74H83joASszIG4DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEksAA0A4h7yrDkjMtjrX3Hl2or-A&amp;sig2=5h1IVLrjZd3we_2pF017GA&amp;bvm=bv.59026428,d.cGU\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Games for Change</span></a>. It\u2019s co-founder, Asi Burak captures the possibilities of games in addressing real social problems: \u201cWe\u2019re used to dealing with serious issues in movies and books, but there can be very little impact beyond awareness. For better or for worse, what we\u2019ll experience with this new frontier will be very, very different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since its launch, Half the Sky has attracted over 1.1 million players on Facebook; 250,000 books have been\u00a0 donated; $163,000 in fistula surgeries have been performed; and $450,000 was raised by players in the form of sponsored and direct donations.</p>\n<p>Half the Sky is a powerful platform which connects people to people by raising awareness and making it easier to take action. It&#8217;s a unique model which connects in-game items with their real world counterparts through an innovative donation distribution system (think if Farmville employed this with it&#8217;s crops!) You can expect to see more of these mechanics employed as gamification continues to grow as a promising method for generating real world action.</p>\n",

And 2013 was the year that a new book was published exploring this exact topic. It\u2019s called<i> </i><i>Play at Work: How Games Inspire Breakthrough Thinking</i> by Adam Penenberg, a professor of journalism at New York University. He is also the assistant director at NYU\u2019s business and economic program. As a media contributor, he has written for Fast Company, New York Times, Washington Post. He as also appeared on the Today Show, American Morning on CNN, ABC\u2019s World News and Money Line.</p>\n<p>Penenberg reminds us that games are everywhere. They are no longer thought of as being just for children and computer geeks. There is an endless array of \u00a0mobile game apps for kids of all ages. Twitter can be considered a game where interesting tweets can grow the number of RT\u2019s and followers. There are also lottery games like Powerball, Take Five and Mega Millions. Nissan has even incorporated a game within their newest models to encourage drivers to compete for the best efficiency levels.</p>\n<p>Traditional forms of teaching seek to inspire learning, creativity, divergent thought processes, personal productivity and smart problem solving. \u00a0As much as parents and teachers want to impart these lessons, they feel like obligatory lists of shoulds and to-do\u2019s for most people. \u00a0But when these objectives are integrated with thoughtful game design, they can be met quite easily and effortlessly. This dynamic has led to the development of highly innovative and practical applications for learning and productivity, \u00a0particularly for business organizations, science, \u00a0medicine, technology and culture.</p>\n<p>The use of game mechanics within the workplace and other fields which depend on innovation has led to phenomenal results. Not only is information being easily assimilated and remembered, but also being applied effectively in real situations. And through quality game design, purposeful ideas and solutions are being generated at a faster rate than ever before.</p>\n<p>Penenberg feels that mundane tasks can turn into fun activities that employees would actually be motivated to play. But this is not to say that games should be designed as efforts to squeeze more productivity out of them. Instead, the objective of the game design should be to cultivate a sense of fulfillment, engagement and satisfaction. With this intent, games can be designed to truly provide enriching and rewarding growth experiences, instead of bribing players with points.</p>\n<p>Play at Work cites examples such as Google, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Loreal, Canon, Wells Fargo, Lexus, FedEx, UPS and IBM.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Google uses a currency called Goobles to regulate the usage of server resources, which can be easily used up within the company. Goobles can also be employed for knowledge asset purposes as employees can use them to bet on market predictions.</p>\n<p>Microsoft also implements games to train employees and boost productivity and morale within the company. Their consumers also get to play games as they learn to use the features of Microsoft Office.</p>\n<p>Repair tech specialists at Canon use a drag and drop computer simulation to assemble parts onto a virtual copy system.</p>\n<p>Japanese engineers at Lexus use a sophisticated computer simulation software for testing the safety of their vehicles.</p>\n<p>Cisco was able to boost their sales by 8-12% while reducing their call time by 15%. How did they accomplish this feat? They implemented sims game called My Plan Net. Sales executives take on the roles of CEOS of different service providers so that they can understand how they make decisions and what problems they need to solve. With this insight, they are able to develop sharper sales pitches and strategies needed to boost their performance.</p>\n<p>Target uses game design to help cashiers improve their average speed per transaction. The interface of this technology is included on cash register screens. According to the company, 88% of transactions regularly meet appropriate speed standards. Employees are motivated to enhance their efficiency since scores have an impact on their salaries and promotions.</p>\n<p>The medical field is relying more and more on simulations so that physicians can learn to perform complicated surgical operations, while gaining experience that will help them improve their timing, decision making skills and precision.</p>\n<p>According to the Entertainment Software Association, 70% of major employers are already using gamification to enhance performance and training at their companies. And this organization believes that this year in 2014, we can expect 70% of 2000 major global firms incorporate the use of games within their work environment.</p>\n<h3><b>Research on Gamification</b></h3>\n<p>In an interview with Forbes, Penenberg also discussed the appeal of games from the perspective of brain researchers.</p>\n<p>Game environments are designed to provide relatively immediate experiences of gratification, particularly through feelings of achievement and accomplishment. This does not occur as frequently within real life situations.</p>\n<p>The feel good sensations (that make us want to keep playing) originate from surges of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Scientists believe that these pathways were originally shaped by the survival instincts during the earliest phases of human evolution. Our ancestors had to constantly escape danger and acquire their means for sustenance. \u00a0This is how they derived their sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<p>In our modern world, \u00a0games provoke similar drives where players have to escape from negative consequences and use strategic thinking to win rewards. These mechanics trigger dopamine pathways that were originally aligned with survival. \u00a0But \u00a0they are stimulated within controlled contexts where the stimuli is pertinent to the times that we now live in.</p>\n<p>Gary Marcus is a research psychologist from New York University is the author of a book called <i>The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind</i>. He believes that our pleasure centers consist of multiple pathways which can be selectively activated by games and other forms of \u201cpleasure technologies\u201d like movies and music.</p>\n<h3><b>Exploitation Versus Accomplishing Great Things</b></h3>\n<p>Penenberg wrote Play to Work in hopes that games will help humanity accomplish great things, as opposed to acting merely as manipulative tools which serve as a means to an end. He gives game examples such as:</p>\n<p><b>1) Fold It: </b>Participants come up with different ways to fold proteins. The results are then scored and by scientists to see which ones have the potential to create the strongest impact in real life situations</p>\n<p><b>2) Galaxy Zoo: </b>Players collaborate to classify astronomical objects like planets, stars, and solar systems. When the game was first designed, it was estimated that it would take a year to classify a million objects. But in fact it took a day to classify 50 million objects</p>\n<p><b>3) Eye Wire: </b>MIT developed this game to enable participants to map retinal connections and collate information to help scientists learn more about visual perception</p>\n<p><b>4) Ancient Lives: </b>Players help to decode ancient texts from Egypt</p>\n<p><b>5) Whale FM </b>\u00a0Oceanologists listen to sounds made by orcas and match them to similar sounding calls</p>\n<p>The author also predicts that along with great developments in gamification, there will also be poor ones as well. Game design has the potential to be gimmicky. And for those created to enhance performance in the work force, there is also the risk of exploiting employees.</p>\n<p>The difference between good games and bad games is the quality of the design to provide rewarding experiences for the players.</p>\n",

As a result, it&#8217;s priced accordingly for those who really believe that this can make a huge impact in their professional lives (as they did on myself and many people I know.</p>\n<h3>About the Gamification Speakers</h3>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_4186\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4186\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-27-at-1.29.55-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4186\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-27-at-1.29.55-PM.png?resize=600%2C441&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gamification Gurus List\" width=\"600\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-27-at-1.29.55-PM.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-27-at-1.29.55-PM.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4186\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gamification Gurus List by UK-Based Leaderboarded.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>If you guys are not familiar with Mario Herger, he has been championing gamification for many years as a Senior Strategist in SAP. Whereas I am more about hardcore gamification experience design and startups (we&#8217;re all pretty well-rounded though), he has deep knowledge in the implementation of gamification in the enterprise space &#8211; working with compliance, legal, budgeting, reporting. He is also one of the biggest experts I know regarding enterprise motivation and competition.</p>\n<p>Both Mario and I consistently have been ranked Top 3 in the Gamification Gurus list on UK Based Leaderboarded.com, which isn&#8217;t to say that it&#8217;s the most legitimate way to measure gamification knowledge and ability (since it is more of a measure of influence and focus), but it&#8217;s always a nice reference.</p>\n<p>And if you are unfamiliar with me&#8230;look around the site. Click on my About page. Watch my videos (but be prepared to watch really goofy stuff).</p>\n<h3>Focus of the Gamification Workshop</h3>\n<p>Mario and I will each divide up the two days and take over one day each.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Day One will be Mario Herger, where he will be explaining how Gamification can be implemented and pushed inside an enterprise environment, from beginning to end.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Onboarding \u2013 Introduction to Enterprise Gamification</li>\n<li>Defining the Challenge &amp; Goals</li>\n<li>Understanding the Player(s)</li>\n<li>Learning about Gamification Design and Game Mechanics</li>\n<li>Gamifying the Application / Process / Activity</li>\n<li>Growing &amp; Sustaining the Application / Process / Activity</li>\n<li>Considering National and International Legal Restrictions</li>\n<li>Building Awareness and Support for Gamification in your Organization</li>\n<li>Developing a Holistic Corporate Gamification Strategy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Day Two will be me really drilling down into good gamification design from an experience standpoint and really teach you guys how to not just copy the Shell of a gamification design, but creative absorb and produce the essence of it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll obviously be covering a lot of the Octalysis, starting from Level 1 and moving all the way up to Level 3. I&#8217;ll be talking about some concepts that I have never published yet. Concepts like &#8220;Anti-Core Drives,&#8221; the &#8220;Strategy Dashboard,&#8221; and explaining more of what those fancy game techniques mean that I throw around so much.</p>\n<p>The goal is that, after the workshop, you will be able to really run Octalysis in a sophisticated level, to the point where I MYSELF would feel comfortable hiring you to do my work.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, I&#8217;ll also be working with you guys to ensure that you will be able to get the Level 1 Octalysis Certificate, either in the workshop, or as follow-ups afterwards. That will all be covered in the workshop fees. Keep in mind that many have given me submissions, but I have only given out 2 Certificates so far.</p>\n<p>Finally, you know how I always like to give out perks for those who are ranked high on my site (again, it just means I appreciate the time you have spent to share and engage with my content)? Well, if you are ranked high on my site, send me an email (include where you are ranking), and I will likely be able to pull some strings for you \ud83d\ude09 Another way is help contribute to the Gamification Wiki at Enterprise-Gamification.com. I know many of you are not in the Bay Area, so probably this only affect a few people (I&#8217;m happy to hang out with you more, even provide a couch if anyone is traveling from afar just to attend this workshop btw).</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

But the people behind the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://internet-response-league.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Internet-Response League</span></a></span> view this as an untapped social potential that can drive the accomplishment of enormous feats, the solving of tough problems, and the saving of lives in times of crisis and disaster.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/iYIQyfRD0xs\" height=\"315\" width=\"420\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The initiative is headed by Peter Mosur, Patrick Meier and Ahmed Meheina. Peter is a graduate student at the Metropolitan College of New York who studies emergency management. Patrick\u00a0 is an expert on next generation human technology and has co-directed a Harvard program on Crisis Mapping. Ahmed is an undergraduate at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Alexandra who is studying communications and electronics. So what do these three have to do with this untapped potential?</p>\n<p>The Internet Response League focuses on mobilizing and leveraging MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) communities. These groups have high numbers of players engaged with online game play where a healthy dose of enthusiasm is needed to solve difficult mission-driven challenges. With the right strategy, this problem-solving energy can be harnessed to produce socially conscious actions.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Currently IRL is in the early stages of developing a plug-in that would enable gamers to perform actions that would help natural disaster response teams in their relief efforts. They hope that collectively, these compassionate gamers would improve response times and as a result, help save more lives. IRL is currently speaking to indie game developers and according to Slate.com, are also <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/08/07/internet_response_league_hopes_to_use_gamers_powers_for_good.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">discussing their concept with World of Warcraft and League of Legends</span></a></span>.</p>\n<h3><b>Power in Numbers \u2013 MMORPGs</b></h3>\n<p>The most well known example of an MMORPG is World of Warcraft which currently has over 9.6 million subscribers. Context: This is larger than the population of Sweden and collectively, they spend over 3.5 billion hours on a weekly basis playing. With such a large number of users so actively engaged, they could represent quite the mobilizing force!</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s look at natural disasters. During Typhoon Haiyan and Hurricane Sandy&#8217;s devastating course, countless tweets and social media photos were posted (During Hurricane Sandy, over half a million Instagram photos were posted online along with 20 million tweets). Many of these contain valuable information that rescue workers need in order to successfully navigate the disaster area and save people who are trapped and isolated. For example a tweet might include the name of a street where there are fallen trees and power lines.</p>\n<p>Although they need to act quickly, rescue organizations do not have access to large numbers of volunteers to sift through all the social media data in order to gather the most relevant info. Que gamers to the rescue!</p>\n<p>With help from MMORPG gamers, this feat could potentially be accomplished in as little as an hour. The task of tagging photos and social media info can integrated with game mechanics to produce a fun, challenging, and highly rewarding experience for players. Possible examples include geo-tagging details such as names of places, latitude, longitude, altitude, bearing and distant or tagging information according to levels of damage. Perhaps most importantly, players could identify urgent information that would then be designated for high priority action- a fire or where rescue and emergency medical care is needed most.</p>\n<p>The collective efforts of the gamers would ultimately contribute to the creation of a crisis map which would help rescue workers effectively navigate the disaster zone. It would provide strategic details about an area and include locations for clean water, regions to avoid, and the nearest medical aid stations.</p>\n<h3><b>Incorporating Rescue Tasks Within A Game Environment</b></h3>\n<p>The challenge of collating information about a real life disaster would need to be integrated within the context limits of the actual players. Here is one possibility in using gamification, proposed by the Internet Rescue League:</p>\n<p>Data from an open source map would be used as a basic foundation for generating a map of the actual city within the game environment.\u00a0 Each player would receive a quest where they would be required to complete a task. Based on the information gathered, players would be able to see the map being updated in real time.</p>\n<p>For their participation, players could earn rewards such as: battle pets, transmog gear, gold or even character level ups. \u00a0Acquiring these types of rewards may even give them a competitive edge on leader boards.</p>\n<p>IRL also suggests ramping up the excitement by enabling competitions among different gaming communities. \u00a0Examples might include \u00a0Xbox Live against Play Station or Network versus Steam.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ccs3hNS7aXA\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Who would argue with the fact that helping disaster relief operations and victims is a great cause?\u00a0 However, when viewing this type of project from a business perspective, one might wonder if this would actually benefit the companies who develop MMORPGs.</p>\n<p>The Internet Response League believes that aiding rescues could most certainly create a win-win situation for both the business organization and the cause. Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<p>Despite its popularity, gaming also has its dissidents. Hardcore game enthusiasts are often joked about in the media for their nerdy propensity for self indulgence. On a more serious note, there are even stories in the news about players who died because they were so immersed in a game. This can happen from blood clots that develop from sitting for long periods, or even forgetting to eat or drink! In essence, hardcore gamers are often perceived as disengaged from real life since they are emotionally invested in fictional worlds.</p>\n<p>Gaming may have earned a bad reputation by some of these accounts. But like anything else in life, there is the good as well as the bad.</p>\n<p>IRL feels that rescue relief endeavors offer gaming companies the opportunity to demonstrate the positive potential of games to actually make a significant difference in the world. \u00a0In so doing, they could then win new converts, which would help to increase their sales. As we are now seeing with the success of many different kinds of socially-conscious gamification examples (see <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/top-10-gamification-examples-human-race/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">&#8220;Top 10 Social Gamification Examples that will Literally Save the World&#8221;</span></a></span>), there&#8217;s a strong desire to holistically combine passion for games with our compassion for others.</p>\n<h3><b>Demand for Games that Help Save Lives<br />\n</b></h3>\n<p>To further validate IRL&#8217;s vision, here&#8217;s another example of an intersection between the gaming world and disaster relief.</p>\n<p>CCP Games is the company who developed EVE Online. They launched a campaign called \u201c<a href=\"http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/plex-for-good-philippines-typhoon-relief/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">PLEX for Good</span></a>\u201d to help victims of Typhoon Haiyan/ Yolanda. For those of you who are not familiar with the game, PLEX stands for Pilot License Extension. It is an item that has value within the game setting as well as real world monetary value.\u00a0 For every PLEX donated, CCP Games would give $15 to the Icelandic Red Cross to help with relief efforts in the Philippines.</p>\n<p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p>\n<p>Games help us become aware of how we act and behave when an activity is perceived as being enjoyable instead of an obligation. When we are deeply engrossed in what we are doing and having fun, it feels like we expend very little energy to achieve our goals.\u00a0 As a result, we are capable of being enormously creative and productive. When this is applied towards an important cause, real world feats that would have otherwise seemed daunting become quite possible. Such is the power of games to help change the world and save lives.</p>\n",

We have a love, hate relationship with them.</p>\n<p>There are alarms that fly around sending you on a blurry chase in the morning or ones that wake you to the gentle rising of a fake sun. These innovative alarms rely on harder or softer sensory feedback to get you up, but some of the most exciting wake-up solutions are coming from a growing market of gamified alarms and app designs.</p>\n<p>I present to you here, 8 of the most engaging gamified wake-ups to help illustrate the gamification techniques at each point around the <a href=\"http://prezi.com/kbaniv-znrdb/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy\">Octalysis Alarm Clock</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>1) Epic Meaning &amp; Calling: Shadow</strong></h3>\n<p>The team behind &#8220;Shadow&#8221; have got epic meaning nailed with an epic goal for building the world&#8217;s largest database of dreams for the betterment of humanity, no less.</p>\n<h3><b>2) Development &amp; Accomplishment: </b><strong>Wake n Shake</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wake n Shake is one of the gamified alarms heavily using achievement symbols in its design.</p>\n<h3><b>3)\u00a0</b><b>Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback: Sleep Cycle</b></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &#8220;Sleep Cycle&#8221; iOS app doesn&#8217;t just work as an alarm, but tracks and records your sleeping hours enabling you to analyse and adjust your sleep-play.</p>\n<h3><b style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; color: #444444; font-size: 1rem; text-decoration: underline;\"> </b>4) Ownership &amp; Possession: AlarmMon</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The AlarmMon app gets you to set-up your alarms with the different choices of cute characters to build your own wake-up experience from scratch.</p>\n<h3><b>5) Social Influence: Spotify The Social Alarm Clock</b></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This alarm from Spotify is still in concept stage, but shows an app that will give you the ability to create and send re-mixed alarm tones and wake-up messages to friends.</p>\n<h3><b>6) Scarcity &amp; Impatience: Starbucks Early Bird</b></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As soon as you accept the &#8216;Starbucks Early Bird&#8217; wake-up it gives you a 1 hour countdown to get yourself down to the nearest store to claim a discounted cup of coffee or build up points towards future ones.</p>\n<h3>7) Curiosity &amp; Unpredictability: Brian Blessed Alarm</h3>\n<p>For pure mischief (Game technique #51). I give you the &#8216;Brian Blessed&#8217; alarm. Will it be Shakespeare, an insult or Brain on a rocket?</p>\n<h3>8) Loss &amp; Avoidance: SnuzNLuz</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The SnuzNLuz alarm still stands out as putting the most interesting and perverse twist on the idea of charitable giving as something you&#8217;d want to avoid!</p>\n",

We&#8217;re very close to finishing up the 8 Core Drives series. Phew, took some work! Now that I have a great helper to edit and complete the videos, I think we will be improving our momentum of these video releases.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty excited, because as you may have noticed, I have been repeating the basic foundational materials on many mediums so far. Many of you may begin to think that this is the only stuff there is in my framework (Don&#8217;t forget there are 5 levels!). It&#8217;s just that you really need to understand the foundation before moving on to more advanced levels.</p>\n<p>During speeches and workshops, most of my audiences don&#8217;t have knowledge of Octalysis, so I can&#8217;t cover the more advanced stuff in a shorter time-span. The advantage of the Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification is that, with 90 Episodes, I can truly dive into the deep and advanced stuff of Octalysis Gamification and teach a lot of things that you wouldn&#8217;t be able to learn in a short period of time.</p>\n<p>After we finish the 8 Core Drives, I&#8217;ll have one episode dedicated to just talking about the course and what we&#8217;re looking at ahead.</p>\n<p>Then we&#8217;ll also cover some other basics such as White Hat vs Black Hat, Right Brain vs Left Brain, possibly the process of good Gamification Design, and then dedicate some episodes in Gamification in the Education Space.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n",

Some readers have told me that they have learned way more from my site than from other expert-certified courses, so they asked if I would create a certification program for them too.</p>\n<p>I entertained the idea on my <a title=\"Video Course\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/video-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification Video Series</a> just to see what kind of interest I get. Level 1 Octalysis involves sending me a full analysis of any engaging product with the 8 Core Drives in mind. Naturally, like Octalysis, there are 5 Levels within this Certification, but so far only Level 1 is available to the public.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, I received a decent amount of submissions, with some being better than others.</p>\n<h3>An Achievement Symbol is only valuable if it is an actual achievement (and Scarce)</h3>\n<p><!--more-->If you guys have been learning from my stuff, you&#8217;ll know that an Achievement Symbol is only valuable if the user can actually feel proud of it.</p>\n<p>In this case, my goal is not to give out a bunch certificates, but to make sure it actually means something. Actually, it would be great if anyone who hires someone with an Octalysis certificate will see impressive great work in gamification from that person. That would make me very happy.</p>\n<p>So after reviewing numerous submissions, I finally let two people pass their Level 1 Octalysis Certification &#8211; I think I will start recording the names of people who pass it on each level on a separate page on this site at one point.</p>\n<p>Once there are at least thirty Level 1 Octalysis Certificates given out, I&#8217;ll start to make available the Level 2 Octalysis Certificate (after all, the levels make little sense if only 3 people have taken them and all 3 have all the levels&#8230;). Extra bonus who knows what Game Technique (and #) this is.</p>\n<p>Level 2 Octalysis will be MUCH harder than Level 1 and requires good analytical and experience design senses. You should look forward to it. Basically, if you pass Level 2, I personally would want to hire you. And that&#8217;s saying a lot.</p>\n<h3>Monetization? How much does it cost to get an Gamification Certificate in Octalysis?</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this topic a bit. I&#8217;ve heard that some expert certification programs out there offer it mostly for monetization purposes &#8211; people pay a decent amount of money, pass an easy test, and then have something they put on their resumes.</p>\n<p>As you guys may know, my main passion is to get as many people out there as possible to design gamification properly. I would like them to try learning Octalysis and I would love to give feedback. However, my time is becoming less and less available, and each hour I don&#8217;t spend on paying clients (and writing my book and updating this blog, making videos&#8230;), I&#8217;m likely sacrificing sleep or upsetting my family who are neglected.</p>\n<p>Generally, I don&#8217;t want to charge a lot of money and pass a lot of people. I also don&#8217;t want to charge a lot of money and fail a lot of people (badly designed incentives for myself). But if it is free, I&#8217;ll get too many submissions and it would take up too much time for me to explain why I did not pass someone.</p>\n<h3>Are you doing it for the Credentials or for the Education?</h3>\n<p>So at the end of the day, this is what I want to do:</p>\n<p>For Level 1 Octalysis Certificates, if you just want to get a certificate, you can send in your submission for free. However, what you will get is simply a Pass/No Pass response from me or someone on my team. I will not explain why it wasn&#8217;t passed (but since I didn&#8217;t charge you money, it&#8217;s fair, as I did invest time to look through it anyway). Also, I cannot guarantee how timely this response would be. It might take a week, or it might take 2 months.</p>\n<p>However, if you want a response with feedback on your submission, including why you DID or DID NOT pass, I will charge $50 per submission. That way you get some education directly from me regardless if you qualify for the certificate or not, and I can justify my time a little bit more (though this is MUCH lower than my hourly rates). I can also guarantee a response within 2 weeks max.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think about this. Since Level 2 Octalysis Submission will be a lot more involved and will mean a lot more, I think I will charge a steeper price in general for that (just for heads up).</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also, if you are among the Top 10 Members that are ranked in my site&#8217;s PBL system on the right for that particular month (ending last day each month), you can get a detailed feedback submission for free, as long as you make that clear in the submission</span> (so you better see this!). Again, if I know you have spent the time to learn my stuff here on my site and have even communicated with a few other members too, I will be a lot more generous with my time too \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<h3>How to Submit?</h3>\n<p>Submission for Level 1 Octalysis Certificates are explained in one of the Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification Videos, including a private email address that is only shown there and will always take priority. However, for a bit of ubiquity I will share what to do here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find a product or experience you are interested in. Could be your own company&#8217;s product.</li>\n<li>Run Octalysis through it and analyze why it is engaging through the 8 Core Drives.</li>\n<li>Utilize the Octalysis Tool to create the graphs (or use your own methods)</li>\n<li>Put your analysis and graphs into a Word/PPT/Keynote file. You can do PDF too, but makes it harder for me to just add comments.</li>\n<li>Talk about how the product/experience can increase engagement through the 8 Core Drives. What&#8217;s missing? And what can be added?</li>\n<li>Send your submission to yukai@yukaichou.com. Include in your email whether you are &#8220;Certificate Only&#8221; or &#8220;Feedback Requested.&#8221;</li>\n<li>If you choose Feedback Requested (again, pass or no-pass without any feedback is free), also Paypal $50 to the same email address (be clear which submission the payment is connected to). Also, you can add another $50 for me to laminate it and physically mail it to you if you like to hold onto something special yourself.</li>\n<li>Within 3 weeks, I should respond with a Pass/No Pass, potentially some feedback, as well as a beautifully crafted Octalysis Certificate. I&#8217;ll also likely share your submission (with my notes and comments) on this site for educational purposes (with your permission), which may be a good way for you to promote your project too.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions, and looking forward to have true experts in Octalysis Gamification within the industry!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Finally made the 15th episode. Woot!</p>\n<p>It probably won&#8217;t take long to notice that the video is done in a different style and done by someone else! That&#8217;s right. We have our good old pal Nikita, whom I met on Twitter, to gracefully put together this new video with techno music and better graphics of my face.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of transitional learning, basically me figuring out how to get something so intimate as me talking straight for 10 minutes (which is me really talking for 1 hour cut down into 10 minutes) and hand that to someone else. Would he make me look fatter? Would I sound dumber? What if he put in a scene where I was using the bathroom??</p>\n<p>All those are difficult questions to answer in life and fortunately the video turned out good (besides my usual shakiness&#8230;grr, must walk better&#8230;or walk the talk!)</p>\n<p>Nikita is Russian (studying in London) so he can take some harsh comments (I already emptied my magazine on him and he is still standing strong like a terminator). If you see how things can improve (or if you like the techno music a lot less than the mysterious suspenseful ambience that I previously put in), let us know!</p>\n<p>Work&#8217;s been busy (still procrastinating on hiring me to be your consultant?), so I figured I had to transition it to someone so that I can actually realistically finish my amazing series one day.</p>\n<p>Nothing else is that new&#8230;.speaking in Florida, speaking in China (best hospitality I ever received from a company &#8211; thank you Huawei!), speaking in India (lots of drama with getting a visa), speaking in Europe, launched the Octalysis Tool so <a title=\"Octalysis with String\" href=\"https://twitter.com/kokopus_dark/status/398784662799405057/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\">people in Barcelona don&#8217;t have to make the Octalysis chart with string</a>, trying to figure out how to make money for my blog so I can at least pay for it&#8217;s own operations, got accepted to speak at SxSW (thank you HelloBar and all my awesome readers!), book coming out hopefully early next year, said sweet things to my wife&#8230;yea really nothing that new or special is going on these days. It&#8217;s the usual boring stuff any Gamification Gosu faces. I wished there was something that made my life awesome.</p>\n<h3>Gamification Video Outline (Because SEO is important!)</h3>\n<p>Oh yea, this video covers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scarcity &amp; Impatience as the 6th Core Drive of Octalysis Gamification</li>\n<li>Facebook uses this to make things exclusive and drives up demand</li>\n<li>Games use this core drive to monetize: dangling works!</li>\n<li>Torture Breaks will make people think about the experience all their time</li>\n<li>Scarcity &amp; Impatience is a lot of Black Hat Gamification. You want to balance them out with White Hat Game Techniques.</li>\n<li>The demand curve for traditional economics theory often becomes a C-Curve</li>\n<li>A super secret key point about Scarcity &amp; Impatience that I&#8217;m not going to tell you about, just so you can understand Scarcity &amp; Impatience \ud83d\ude09</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Isn&#8217;t that what games and life is all about?</em></p>\n<h3>750words.com:\u00a0The Gamification of writing</h3>\n<p>I have been using Buster Benson&#8217;s gamified writing site,\u00a0<a href=\"http://750words.com/\" target=\"_blank\">750words.com</a>,\u00a0for\u00a0over 100 days now and\u00a0I\u2019ll admit to having a bit of a site-crush. I visit it\u00a0on a daily basis and though I&#8217;m only at the beginning of what might become a beautiful friendship, other long term users clearly <a href=\"http://750words.com/patrons?page=1\">feel the same</a>.</p>\n<p>Among them, many have been engaged with the site for years. Writing their 750 words every, single, day.</p>\n<p>Gamification is often put forward as a solution that promises this kind of \u00a0passionate and committed long term engagement. But how many gamified sites really embed themselves into your daily habits not just a month, but over years?</p>\n<p>I was curious to look a little deeper through the lens of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\">Octalysis framework</a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/experience-phases-game/\">4 experience phases</a> of \u00a0the player journey.</p>\n<h3>The Empowerment to just write</h3>\n<p>Firstly and importantly the site&#8217;s every design choice feels tightly focused\u00a0around a central goal. Write every day.</p>\n<p>Sounds easy, but anyone who&#8217;s actually tried to write that novel, get down some of that essay or write a journal entry after a long day knows that finding that writer&#8217;s flow is often difficult.</p>\n<p>This is why it feels such an empowering first experience when you log-in to the site. Before anything else, any browsing or the site showing off, you are simply challenged to write. In our digital lives filled with endless procrastination and distraction at every turn, a blank page with its sole intent at its centre feels refreshingly honest.</p>\n<p>This is simple <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-3-empowerment-creativity-feedback/\" target=\"_blank\">Empowerment</a>\u00a0of Creativity &amp; Feedback (Core Drive 3). Like any sandbox game you are given the tools early on and all the freedom to attack it anyway you want. The site name itself is all the tutorial for the <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/4-experience-phases-gamification-2-onboarding-phase/\">on-boarding phase</a> you need and the objective is clear from the moment you type in the url, &#8220;750words&#8221;. Go.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it could have all gone wrong; A standard frame of menus, the badges, list of other users and challenges all gamified elements used later, if introduced at this point would have been a disaster.\u00a0Those sparks for another chain of thought and suddenly your writing muse has wandered off.</p>\n<p>Instead the gamification \u00a0recognizes the different player journey phases and by focusing in on empowerment gets you to that early win-state of a successful writing day completed.</p>\n<h3>Simple and visual feedback on progress</h3>\n<p><!--more-->In line with this stripped back design, there is no big progress bar with some swirly lights for feedback.\u00a0The smallest of word counters is placed at the bottom of the page along with a time stamp update that let&#8217;s you know an autosave has happened. \u00a0Its subtle and functional, but marks your\u00a0 progress \u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-2-development-accomplishment/\" target=\"_blank\">Accomplishment</a>\u00a0(Core Drive 2)\u00a0every word along the way.</p>\n<p>Once completed, the day is then marked by an X for the month you&#8217;re in.\u00a0A kiss perhaps, I thought at first&#8230;</p>\n<p>Why not a more fancy icon? When the Xs start to build up in a little chain across the top of those empty boxes, it starts to make sense. Strike!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3647 aligncenter\" alt=\"750words.com daily progress mark for writing each day\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/750x.jpg?resize=600%2C72&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/750x.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/750x.jpg?resize=300%2C36&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>I can almost hear the skittles falling over and in my head I do the obligatory turn around, fist pump and jaunty walk back to the pit.</p>\n<p>If you happen to only part complete your writing on any given day. The box fills with the tantalising spare  and an email is sent reminding you to not give up. It&#8217;s a clever visual feedback trick, that challenges you to do the bowling unthinkable and turn your spare into a full strike.</p>\n<h3>Rewarding commitment and consistency</h3>\n<p>After completing the most important action of writing. The site opens up its second layer of accomplishment that further reinforces long term engagement.</p>\n<p>Like an attentive partner each visit it reminds me when we first started our journey together. It even wants to celebrate our\u00a0 anniversary by giving me a penguin. Ahhhh!</p>\n<p>The scaffolding phase is led by the badges. Animal badges reflect the milestones of 5&#8230;30..etc days of writing in a row. The chain of Xs and the promise of a new badge is enough to encourage me to avoid breaking my streak (Core Drive 8,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-loss-and-avoidance/\" target=\"_blank\">Loss &amp; Avoidance</a>). It\u2019s a long way to fall back to day 1 on the way to that impressive and coveted 500 days Space Bird status (Core Drive 5,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-of-gamification-5-social-pressure-and-envy/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Influence</a>).</p>\n<p>The next thing you&#8217;ll notice is the available special badges for certain behaviours and the collector in us is inspired (Core Drive 4,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-4-ownership-possession/\" target=\"_blank\">Ownership</a>). Type consistently fast and get the Cheetah badge. Type without distractions and get the Hamster badge. Each one is designed to illicit a certain behaviour that pushes you to stretch your writing muscles and habits.</p>\n<h3>Profiling the quantified writer</h3>\n<p>Even without these badges though. The ownership drive is also satisfied by the really interesting use of a writing analysis page</p>\n<p>The pretty graphs and meta-analysis of my thoughts and feelings on any given day are often surprising. Providing a personalised dose of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/the-8-core-drives-of-gamification-7-unpredictability/\" target=\"_blank\">unpredictability</a>\u00a0(Core Drive 7). I&#8217;m always curious to see if the algorithm thinks my writing was extrovert or introvert, upset or happy?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3649 aligncenter\" alt=\"750words.com Mindset graph for completing writing each day \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/750mindset.jpg?resize=600%2C201&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/750mindset.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/750mindset.jpg?resize=300%2C101&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>This customization is more powerful than any avatar or profile. By intimately linking my presence on the site back to the core action of writing, the gamification once again reinforces the writing. Like staring in the fun house writer&#8217;s mirror, stripped past the choices I might have made on a profile. Instead here is a reflection of my writers face revealed by the words themselves.</p>\n<p>So, Buster admits this is not exactly a full-proof algorithm, but I think this rather adds to its fun. Apparently I was pretty &#8220;touchy&#8221; and &#8220;feely&#8221; about my &#8220;future success&#8221; today.</p>\n<h3>Writing alone together</h3>\n<p>Then there is the one month challenge. A re-occurring chance to write 750 words every day within a single month.</p>\n<p>The wall of awesomeness celebrates the champions and wall of shame is there to chide the losers at the end of each month. There is a countdown of challengers as they fall to the wayside each month and it brings together the usually invisible users as a group working towards a common writing goal. The challenge introduces an important element of competition and\u00a0social pressure.</p>\n<p>The voluntary sign-up to the month also asks each individual to fill in their own reward or penalty for the challenge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I succeed, I will&#8230; treat myself to x.<br />\nIf I miss a day or more, I will&#8230; y&#8221;</p>\n<p>This simple self-made narrative, witnessed by your fellow participants is powerful. Instead of shoehorning some standardised\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-1-epic-meaning-calling/\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Meaning</a>\u00a0(Core Drive 1) into your interaction, it astutely allows you to craft your own. A sure fire way to tap into the intrinsic or extrinsic motivations that drive you.</p>\n<h3>Egg to Spacebird: Long term engagement from Discovery to Endgame</h3>\n<p>I first discovered the site in one of those serendipitous online conversations. Where a virtual stranger tells you in the hushed tones of a friend sharing a secret, of something special they have discovered.</p>\n<p>This was very consistent with the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/4-experience-phases-gamification-1-discovery-phase/\" target=\"_blank\">discovery phase</a>\u00a0as an effective way of engaging curiosity (Core Drive 7) and the social influence (Core Drive 5) offered by the word of mouth from one writer to another.</p>\n<p>Once you have joined the site, achieved your first few Xs and started the daily mastery towards a few badges, the final experience phase of gamification, the Endgame, comes into view.</p>\n<p>This is where the relatively underused\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-6-scarcity-impatience/\" target=\"_blank\">scarcity</a>\u00a0(Core Drive 6) appears.\u00a0The patron cup of coffee is the only way to contribute and appear on the site beyond the core action of writing. It allows you to vote for site features or post an inspirational note on the patron page.\u00a0Cups of coffee can only be obtained by donations or earned from monthly challenges.</p>\n<p>These cups of coffee therefore encourage a sense of belonging to the community and investment in its future development. They can also be donated into a winner\u2019s pool for the monthly challenges, as a way for users to give back to the community and demonstrate their mastery. For example, one member I saw recently giving away 40 cups to the winners pool.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, there is also a locked down feature area, which is limited to early day members of the site. Currently it is impossible to ever earn the right to join this group, and it is therefore an extreme form of scarcity.\u00a0Opening this up as an Endgame opportunity for more recent members to earn, I think, would be one of the\u00a0 practical improvements that Octalysis points to.</p>\n<p>Another, would be to provide new forms of accomplishment and ways to engage with other players potentially using collaborative challenges. For example, there could be a special month challenge,\u00a0\u00a0where\u00a0if 80% of the members signed up complete it successfully, then it will unlock a new badge for everyone.</p>\n<p>This kind of Group Quest would provide a surprising and tangible reward for long term players taking on repeated monthly challenges, as well as new meaning to the writing of inspirational notes as a rallying call to the group to win this prize.</p>\n<h3>Playing the writers game</h3>\n<p>Buster says on the site, he created it out of his own desire and needs for something to motivate his daily writing practice and I believe, you can feel this through the gamified elements.</p>\n<p>Unlike sites with plugin gamification\u00a0features tagged on to the experience, 750words integrates it around this shared desire and at every phase of the writer&#8217;s journey.</p>\n<p>Writing each day can sometimes feel like a lonely experience.</p>\n<p>In the quiet space between the blank page and the words we try to wring out,\u00a0750words delivers an intimate gamified experience.\u00a0Like the daily presence of an encouraging friend, who simply lends you their best pen.</p>\n",

In particular, the company&#8217;s 30-day software trial period is considered to be critical in their marketing strategy and represents a major portion of the website traffic.</p>\n<p>At the recent GSummit SF 2013 Conference, in the session &#8220;Converting Free Users to Paid: Gamification at Autodesk&#8221;, Autodesk Digital Marketing Director Dawn Wolfe and Resource Interactive Managing Director Steven Burke presented the results of two recent projects designed to increase the conversion rate for two Autodesk trial programs. Surprisingly, the first effort was wildly successful, but the second was a failure. We will investigate further and see why.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/JGfX9sd0kHs\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>The Autodesk Product Line</h3>\n<p>In general, Autodesk products are very complex, very powerful, and very expensive. Because of the complexity and sophistication, the learning curves are often quite formidable. Most users take weeks, or even months before they actually gain any true competency. They also represent a major investment, with the cheapest Autodesk product costing $1,200, while its more popular products will run $5,000 per license seat.</p>\n<p>For prospective customers this presents a new challenge &#8211; how do they determine whether a product so sophisticated is justifiable for their needs. These are definitely not products that one would purchase without having a solid understanding of how they can help ones business.</p>\n<h3>The Autodesk In-Trial Program</h3>\n<p>To help engage prospective users (potential buyers), Autodesk offers an In-Trial program. Users can download software design programs and application suites for a 30-day trial period. During this period users can access online tutorials, documentation, and example file sets, to assist them in learning about the software and help assess the their need.</p>\n<p>Autodesk&#8217;s In-Trial program is essential in promoting their software products, while at the same time, critical to the conversion process. In fact, trial downloads are the number one reason that visitors globally use the Autodesk website. As a result, there is a direct link between customer engagement with a trial and their propensity to make a purchase.</p>\n<p>As an example, metrics for Autodesk&#8217;s 3DS Max product trial program shows that for prospective users who employ a trial three or more times, there is a 2x increased likelihood that they will purchase the product. (However, 80% of the trial users only open the product once.) It is therefore very important that the initial engagement with the trial users is positive.</p>\n<p>The Autodesk In-Trial marketing team explored a new objective &#8211; how to increase the conversion rate of new prospects (the trial users) to purchasers. Based on their In-Trial data they hypothesized that by increasing the engagement level of the trial users, the likelihood of them purchasing the product would increase. (In theory, this would expose them to the most compelling aspects of the software products, creating incentives for the trial users and prospects to take the next step and purchase the products.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Autodesk-example-of-gamification-1.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Initiative 1: Gamification for the 3DS Max Trial Program</h3>\n<p>When the 2013 version of the Autodesk 3DS Max software was released, the company employed the digital marketing agency Resource Interactive to create a new, innovative way to increase the trial conversion rate. Resource actually developed an online game called \u201cUndiscovered Territory\u201d that took customers on an entertaining and educational journey.</p>\n<p>The game was advertised within the 3DS Max trial software, providing an entry point into the actual game. Resource developed an entertaining storyline, which incorporated a worldwide race, numerous missions, awards, and Badgeville platform components. At the same time, they evoked social influence mechanics by connecting users with their social marketing sites and community platforms &#8211; including YouTube and Facebook. Overall it was a very robust experience for the users.</p>\n<p>For 3DS Max, the target audience consists of special effects artists, graphics designers, and game developers. This is a pretty safe target group since most are already likely to be utilizing 3DS Max or another Autodesk development product. As such, the target market was considered to be well defined and safe- a necessary condition for engaging users in their trial program&#8217;s gamification platform.</p>\n<p>The results were impressive.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>The key metrics were:</p>\n<p>54% increase in trial usage<br />\n15% increase in buy clicks<br />\n29% increase in channel revenue per trial start</p>\n<p>The 54% increase in trial usage is huge, while the 15% increase in buy clicks is impressive. Thousands were downloading this trial each week and in general, all metrics positively increased across the board.</p>\n<p>As a consequence of these results and because this is a pure B2B play (or nearly so), there was a direct correlation to revenues, and this initiative received a lot of attention. Autodesk won awards from Gartner and from Forester, received substantial press coverage, and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted a case study on their success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The-Apocalypse-Trigger-The-Gamification-of-the-AutoCAD-Design-suite-trial-program.png\"></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Initiative 2: \u00a0Introduction of Gamification for the AutoCAD Design Suite Trial Program</h3>\n<p>With the success of gamifying the 3DS Max Trial Program, the In-Trial marketing team wanted to take that knowledge and go after the core target market, which for Autodesk, are the architect, engineering, and construction communities. When you think about it, there aren&#8217;t many buildings, roads, bridges, etc that did not have an Autodesk product involved with their design. The flagship product being the AutoCAD Design Suite is the &#8220;cash cow&#8221; for this market and the team wanted to see how gamification might work within this target audience.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YWXAGx65yts\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>There was a lot of confidence. The In-Trial team &#8220;knew the drill&#8221; and would again unite with Resource Interactive, incorporate Badgeville on the back end, add the bells and whistles, and build another game for this audience. It would be called &#8220;The Apocalypse Trigger&#8221; and be marketed through the trial program, just like 3DS Max was, and use the Autodesk social networks and communities site, just as \u201cUndiscovered Territory\u201d did&#8230; but with a bigger budget.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Apocalypse Trigger&#8221; had a number of learning missions where starter files were made available, and tutorials were provided for users as they move through the game. As usual, they would win points for completing different tasks and could earn special points as well if they shared their work on Facebook or if they tweeted about the product. And to take advantage of social influence, they implemented a leaderboard to track it all.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was very similar to the \u201cUndiscovered Territory\u201d game. Structurally, the missions, the learning process, the tutorials, and everything else was the same.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The only notable difference was the target audience.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The results were disappointing. The strong increases that were present in the 3DS Max case were totally absent with the AutoCAD Design Suites attempt. In fact, there was actually a decrease in product usage. What happened?</p>\n<p>Actually there is a small caveat: In addition to gamifying the trial experience, the core market audience was actually being exposed to a product that required substantially more involvement than the traditional products they were using. <strong>The target audience that wanted to experience (and was expecting) AutoCAD, were now being shown the AutoCAD Design Suites, a package of various products. The underlying goal was to try and get them to actually use a portfolio of products in tandem- something the target users were not accustomed to or expecting.</strong></p>\n<h3>Lessons Learned from Gamification Initiative II</h3>\n<p>With the decrease in usage, the team had to figure out what they could learn from the experience. What were the results saying? Did this mean that the initial success with gamification was just beginners&#8217; luck? Does this demonstrate that this type of gamified application only works when the target audience are gamers themselves?</p>\n<p>Highly doubtful, the team concluded.</p>\n<p>In the end, they decided to return to the fundamentals of gamification.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s not really about <em>the game\u00a0</em>itself &#8211; it&#8217;s about the game psychology and how the game mechanics help drive behavior.</strong>\u00a0Ironically, when the team showed their project to actual game developers, they were asked about what had led them to the final design. The team&#8217;s response was that they actually started out with the final game concept already in mind, in other words, the design was already established before the core drives of their audience were authentically and comprehensively understood.</p>\n<h3>Doing Gamification Right</h3>\n<p>So, the team changed their strategy &#8211; they started looking at how they could gain deeper understanding about their target market using smaller, simpler mechanics. Now, small pilot programs will be used to gather data and information, which will in turn, provide a fundamental understanding about the demographics and motivations of the market. Instead of simply applying game mechanics because they&#8217;re neat, the team recognizes that gamification principles can be applied to cultivate a dialogue between the company and its users &#8211; a feedback loop that&#8217;s giving them information on what the users are doing, what they want, and want they need.</p>\n<h3>Personal Thoughts from Yu-kai Chou</h3>\n<p>Beyond the very valid and great learnings of the Autodesk team, I think one of the key differences between the two gamification initiatives is the factor of Believability within Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling.</p>\n<p>In the first initiative, users are put into a situation where they can relate to more, even thought about &#8211; traveling the world and solving problems. There is a sense of Relatedness (Core Drive #5) as well as a higher purpose that is believable.</p>\n<p>However, in the second initiative, the user is put into a setting to solve mysterious Maya problems, which will lead to the prevention of the Apocalypse and eventually saving the world (which leads to amazing rewards such as a Lenovo computer). Because the &#8220;Epic Meaning&#8221; is so out there for a serious professional, they relate to it less, and therefore do not engage in it.</p>\n<p>If you ensure a high Believability for your Epic Meaning &amp; Calling, users will become strongly motivated. But if you have a low Believability in your attempts, then many users might even feel insulted and refuse to participate just based on principle. I have a feeling that this is also an issue that affected the performance of the second initiative which was much more refined.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Innovative gamification strategies may always seem to be an option for influencing human behavior, to encourage engagement and promote purchasing decisions. In the case of Autodesk&#8217;s product trial programs, they seemed to hit a home run with their first effort to improve trial conversion rates for the the target market of graphic designers and game developers. However, after using a very similar approach for the flagship CAD designer market, the same gamification initiative bombed.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, the success of the first initiative seem to be largely due to an audience that was more receptive to a gaming environment. Given the nature of this market&#8217;s professional environment, a game design trial product would seem to be acceptable. However, the more stringent professional environment found in architecture and engineering firms, would probably make it difficult to accept a game design trial product.</p>\n<p>In the end, gamifying a particular situation should not be blindly laid down with some generic game design over and over again. Instead, the designers should start with the fundamentals and properly define their target market, learning about the specific traits and characteristics which define it. Then they must determine what is their desired result and how to encourage it. This finally leads them to focusing on the behaviors and motivations that can be influenced by the balanced use of gamification techniques and mechanics.</p>\n<p>(Thanks to Jerry Fuqua for tremendously helping me on this post!)</p>\n",

Finally, I set foot in London to meet my designer, some friends, and potential clients. If you happen to be in those areas, let&#8217;s see if we can find a time to meet!</p>\n",

What makes them particularly tricky is that, depending on how its designed, the PBL game can be encouraging or insulting to users.</p>\n<h3>A Good PBL system can Engage the User</h3>\n<p>A good PBL game encourages the user to engage and dive deeper into content, seek out relevant information, and connect with and ultimately return to the host site (i.e., like my blog).</p>\n<p>Take <a title=\"Khan\" href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Khan Academy</a> for an example. Their \u2018Learning Dashboard\u2019 entices users to take a series of lessons on a range of topics, gaining skill progress points, and achievement awards for completing challenges, while amassing energy points for having watched tutorials and completed quizzes. All of these mechanics ultimately encourages the user to learn math, science, etc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My goal is similar: educate and engage users on human-focused design and gamification techniques. To transform a regular visitor into a bona fide gamification aficionado takes some time. A well designed PBL game would certainly add some cachet for the visitor to keep on reading my articles, watching my videos, and engaging in conversation with yours truly (something I definitely take a lot of enjoyment in <i>and</i> garners many PBL points).</p>\n<h3>Why I Chose the Captain Up Platform</h3>\n<p>And so, after having looked into various PBL platforms, I finally settled on\u00a0<a href=\"http://captainup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Captain Up</a>, an Israeli startup that rewards users for exploring your site and sharing it with your friends. Using a customizable selection of badges and point awards, the platform tracks which users are engaging most within the community and broadcasts their standing via a leadership board.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why did I choose Captain Up over other alternatives?</p>\n<p>Well, on top of having nifty designs, they have a lot of things I can customize &#8211; levels, points, achievements, and actions. I can even reward people for interacting with specific elements on any page- a very important mechanism as I seek to draw visitors\u2019 attention to my <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\">Octalysis Framework</a> and tutorial vids (both of which provide a solid grounding in the core drives and mechanics of Gamification).</p>\n<p>As a gamification designer, I really like to customize my own system, instead of an out-of-the-box-no-tweaking system. I can even create new badges or levels based on images I upload myself!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with different game design concepts and ideas these past few months, and so far, the most recent PBL design (found on the right hand side of the page) has been working very well with a test group of a couple hundred readers signed up to play and are now regularly engaging in my site\u2019s content.</p>\n<h3>Dangers of a Gamified PBL System: Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation</h3>\n<p>Since the topic of Intrinsic and Extrinsic motivation is one of the most common ones in the field, I won&#8217;t go into too much detail about them. But basically, the risk of many PBLs systems is that it shifts motivation from Intrinsic (I want to learn about Octalysis and other great gamification content!) to Extrinsic (I want to level up and earn that badge!).</p>\n<p>Eventually, people could be doing it just for the points, and whereas they would love to read more about gamification to begin with, if I suddenly removed the PBL system that they are attached to, they might lose interest of reading this content altogether.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to prevent something like that from happening, but there are thousands of ways to get it wrong &#8211; which is what many companies don&#8217;t understand right now.</p>\n<h3>How to Design an Engaging Game</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Points-Badges-and-Leaderboard.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Points-Badges-and-Leaderboard.png?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image of a Gamification System\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The default setting rewarded a few points for watching a video and commenting on my blog posts, and a lot more for tweeting and sharing the post on Facebook. The platform is generally sound, especially since I indeed get more value when my readers are sharing my content to others. However, I felt the default points/rewards economy was not optimized.</p>\n<p>The first thing I changed, was making commenting on my blog worth 100 points, and watching a video worth 40 points. Facebook Liking and Tweeting were only worth 25 and 10 points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I changed my system around, the kind folks in Captain Up asked me, \u201cIsn\u2019t 100 points way too much for just commenting?\u201d</p>\n<p>Good question.</p>\n<h3>Communicating a Game Worth Playing</h3>\n<p>During the Discovery and Onboarding Phases of a Player\u2019s Journey (the beginning two phases) <strong>the first thing you want to communicate to users is whether this is \u201ca game worth playing?\u201d </strong></p>\n<p>With the rules you set, you are establishing an interaction with the user and communicating your values.</p>\n<p>If you give people a bunch of points just to do marketing for you, or reward them virtual items for every little stupid thing, users will feel like the game is shallow \u2013 this is not a game worth playing. Users have no interest in a game if they know the game designer is just trying to benefit himself instead of caring about his users.</p>\n<p>For instance, if there are points, progress bars, and badges for \u201cHow much money you donated to the site owner,\u201d people will feel insulted by your lame attempt to use them for solely personal gains.</p>\n<p>People know that sharing on Twitter/Facebook mostly benefits me, and so I don\u2019t want to tell them that my game is about sharing. When I state that commenting on my site is worth more than anything else, I\u2019m expressing that I value interacting *with you* more than anything else. I want to communicate with you, and that is what I value.</p>\n<p>And if you don\u2019t want to talk to me, at least watch my videos so you can learn something! And of course, if you are willing to share my content with your friends and family, I would be very grateful too, but I\u2019m not going to use that as a large carrot in my site.</p>\n<p>This tells users that the key of this game is \u201cengagement.\u201d I want you to be engaged, learn a lot, and participate in a community. <strong>THIS\u00a0becomes a game worth playing.</strong></p>\n<h3>The Real Challenge of the Game</h3>\n<p><!--more-->Once users decide that this is a game worth playing and decide to sign up, we enter the Scaffolding Phase. It&#8217;s not too long until users realize, that to truly excel at the game (how is it possible that people have tens of thousands of points?), you need to get the badges.</p>\n<p>Badges are like bosses, and to obtain those badges, it requires some seriously commitment (like one of the badges is earned if you are consistently on my site every day for 2 months! Who does that right?) Also, this is where users understand that to really win against other people, they will still need to share on their Twitter and Facebook as much as they can. At this point, since they are already playing the game, this is not an absurd setting, as it is only directed towards the hardcore players who want to achieve a high status.</p>\n<p>Of course, badges are earned in many different ways, including commenting with consistency and watching more videos, but whereas in the Onboarding Phase, sharing on Twitter and Facebook are somewhat dismissed as an afterthought, this is where people realize they need to take it seriously. Of course, if you are this much into the game, I believe you would genuinely be enjoying the content and would want to share with friends anyway.</p>\n<h3>Rewards: Earned Lunch vs Easter Eggs vs Drops</h3>\n<p>A little mystery goes a long way.</p>\n<p>The default Captain Up system usually tells people exactly what needs to be done to earn the various badges, such as &#8220;Tweet 50 times to earn this badge!&#8221; This is a Fixed-Action Reward, which I also call the Earned Lunch <strong>(Game Technique #7)</strong>.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s usually no problem with Earned Lunches, as it does motivate people who want to know exactly what they are striving for (Core Drive #6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience).</p>\n<p>However, again, given that many of the activities are benefiting the site owner (such as Yu-kai Chou &#8211; yes, I just addressed myself in third person), users might not like a carrot that is blatantly telling them to &#8220;share my blog on Twitter 1000 times and you will earn this badge!!!&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a result, I turn that into a game in itself with some Core Drive #7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity.</p>\n<p>On my site, the badge system is actually not fully advertised and transparent, and many lightweight users don&#8217;t even know about it.</p>\n<p>But at one point in the Scaffolding phase, you will realize you unlocked a surprise badge that gave you a whopping 15000 points, and then you will think, &#8220;OK, how do I get the other badges?\u201d</p>\n<p>In my study of various types of Rewards, there are <a title=\"The Six Contextual Types of Rewards in Gamification\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/marketing-gamification/six-context-types-rewards-gamification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6 main types of rewards</a>, including Fixed-Action Rewards (Earned Lunch), and Random Rewards (Drops) <strong>(Game Technique #72)</strong>, and Sudden Rewards (Easter Eggs) <strong>(Game Technique #30)</strong>. Like I said, I don&#8217;t want the badges to be the big carrot as a &#8220;fixed-action reward,&#8221; but I very much prefer the Sudden Easter Egg Rewards, and sometimes even Random Drops.</p>\n<p>Even though most of the points are awarded when you unlock badges, there&#8217;s not full transparency on how to earn them (a nice guessing game in itself), but there are certainly hints and clues throughout. Many of the clues lie in the actual description of the badge, as well as a progress bar that shows how close you are towards the goal, and you can correlate that to certain activities.</p>\n<h3>Why so Serious? Context and Playfulness</h3>\n<p>Another big mistake many PBL systems make is taking itself too seriously.</p>\n<p>If you goes onto a site, and clicks a button, and suddenly, a message shows up that says, &#8220;CONGRATULATIONS!!! YOU JUST EARNED THE &#8216;I CLICKED ON MY FIRST BUTTON BADGE&#8217;!!!!You are a Superstar!! Click here to see all the other AWESOME BADGES you can earn!&#8221;</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re not going to be excited. You&#8217;re going to be like, &#8220;Well, this is pretty lame. What else is there? A scrolling down badge? A click on the &#8216;about us page&#8217; badge?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again, the context is all off, and the action does not match the outcome. As a result, users feel insulted. (The right way to do it is to only give them Achievement Symbols &#8211; trophies, stickers, badges, belts, uniforms &#8211; if they actually did something they feel they&#8217;ve accomplished themselves, going back to Core Drive #2).</p>\n<p>So what I do on my system, is to generally be playful and not pretend that this PBL system is the best thing in the world. I do that with custom text and languages throughout the system.</p>\n<p>For instance, the first time you did a Facebook Like on my blog, you will unlock the Like a Um Badge (referencing <a title=\"Like an Um\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv1aqmuyZE8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">THIS video</a>). Instead of saying, &#8220;You are the most awesome person in the world!!&#8221; the text reads, <strong>&#8220;Congratulations. You proved you can like something. You are not morbid.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Again, just not taking things that seriously and being a bit playful. The user then knows that liking something is not that big of a deal, so you don&#8217;t need to insult them by saying they are masters of the Universe.</p>\n<p>Even more directed to this trend, is my communication towards people who do Google +1&#8217;s on my blog. At the beginning, the text reads: &#8220;Oh yea. You know how to do a Google+. Good for you.&#8221; Then afterwards you can unlock a badge that reads, &#8220;Hmm, looks like you are doing more than just experimenting with Google+. Do you need a doctor?&#8221; to the What the Plus Badge, that reads, &#8220;Who uses Google+ that much anyway?&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, towards the end, there&#8217;s a whopping 75,000 points badge (one of the worthiest on my site), that reads, &#8220;Alright. You have proven that you are a true Google+ Fan. You have earned my respect and I will no longer make fun of you for that.&#8221; It&#8217;s almost like a graduation and accomplishment for being persistent and sticking to what you believe in, despite other people making fun of you. I definitely respect and honor that.</p>\n<h3>Levels of Humor</h3>\n<p>I also did a lot of customized design for the levels. First of all, I changed the names of most of the levels (or rearranged the orders) to make them make more sense in my mind.</p>\n<p>Of course, I add a lot of interesting communications that somewhat make fun of users (and myself) too. On Level 2, you achieve the status of Game-Curious. The description reads, &#8220;You are curious about gamification and ready to learn more. Of course, that has nothing to do with your sexual orientation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On Level 14, I uploaded a cool ninja image to become the Gamification Ninja level (anyone putting that on LinkedIn?). But at Level 15, you become a samurai, with a picture of Tom Cruise as a Samurai, and a description that says, &#8220;After regaining your honor as a Ninja, you now step back into the ranks of the Samurai&#8230;just like Tom Cruise.&#8221; (Reference: The Last Samurai).</p>\n<p>Finally, towards the end, the most ultimate and highest level on my site is the status of Gamification Gosu, in which the text reads, &#8220;Congratulations. You have finally become a Gamification Gosu. Now you are just like me. In fact, I should become your apprentice and you can take over my cult.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As you can see, none of it is designed to be taken THAT seriously, but is meant to install a sense of humor, some sarcasm, and a playful attitude, so the user knows that this is just a light-weighted system that&#8217;s not trying to butter them up in exchange of actions, but a system they can have fun, enjoy, and have a good laugh in.</p>\n<p>This is somewhat like hanging out with your friends. If your friends gave you exaggerated gestures of how awesome you are no matter what you do, it&#8217;s pretty lame right? But true friends make fun of each other a lot in a playful manner, in which is more enjoyable than someone sucking up all the time. (There we have some Core Drive 4: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness)</p>\n<h3>Rewards of My Gamification System</h3>\n<p>Now comes the other question &#8211; so what do people get when they are high level or achieved a special badge?</p>\n<p>Well, first of all, none of that is very defined, and I purposely avoid something fixed &#8211; primarily because what I can offer may change in the future, and also I don&#8217;t want to shift things towards extrinsic motivation &#8211; people just clicking on my blog for the final reward.</p>\n<p>I want people to genuinely be curious about interacting with my content, and simply use the system to keep track of their progress.</p>\n<p><strong>However, I do plan to provide A LOT of value to people who are high-scoring Octalysis Gamelites.</strong></p>\n<p>I regularly reach out to individuals who are high scorers on my blog via Facebook/Twitter and start to collaborate with them on different projects.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve helped a couple of them with job referrals, and a few others to become contributors of my blog (with link-backs of their choice).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also given some top scorers exclusive workshops and/or recorded workshops that companies have paid thousands of dollars to access, as well as given free consulting/advice/shoutouts for my Octalysis Gamelites, which easily adds up to hundreds if not thousands of dollars of value too.</p>\n<p>In the future, I&#8217;m continuing to come up with a variety of things I can do for my top scorers, including free access to my paid webinars/workshops, hiring them to my own company (I&#8217;ve actually started to pay some people for projects), showcase their work (or great personalities) in my videos, and ton more.</p>\n<p>Basically, all the good SAPS stuff from <a title=\"Gabe Zich\" href=\"http://twitter.com/gzicherm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gabe Zichermann</a>: Status, Access, Power, Stuff.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, if you are a high scoring Gamelite, that means you have been reading my content a lot, sharing with friends, and having a lot of conversations with me on my blog. With that in mind, I TRULY want to be your friend and appreciate all the time and effort you have spent on my site.</p>\n<p>As a friend, I&#8217;m not dangling a carrot in front of you, but just helping you out with whatever I can with my resources, my network, my reach, and opportunities.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, this is just me try to keep track of who I should spend more time being friendly with, precisely because these people have already spent a lot of their own precious time on me. I want blog-reading to be meaningful on my site, and I&#8217;m not just getting more readers, but building true relationships here.</p>\n<h3>ROI Recognition</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gamification-ROI.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gamification-ROI.png?resize=600%2C367&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gamification ROI\" width=\"600\" height=\"367\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another nice thing about Captain Up, is that you could see the ROI fairly easily/quickly.</p>\n<p>Above is the monthly data from a while ago. This number has increased to 30,000+ visitors a month)</p>\n<p>As you can see, even though people who participate in my Gamification program is only a small % of my users, they are driving a lot more behavior.</p>\n<p>Only 1% of my regular traffic is tweeting my content, but a whopping 50% of Gamelites share on Twitter! Less than 1% of my traffic shares on Facebook, but 70% of Gamelites share there! (Not to mention the 59 Google +1&#8217;s that I make fun of \ud83d\ude09 )</p>\n<p>More importantly for me (seriously), Octalysis Gamelite commented 170 times in the past month, whereas the rest of the folks only commented 48 times. And check this &#8211; on average a person who signed up as an Octalysis Gamelite has watched 6.8 videos! That&#8217;s quite impressive in terms of engagement!</p>\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s very likely that this is a correlation issue instead of a causation issue based on self selection, meaning only my best readers who already want to engage with me such as yourself (hint hint \ud83d\ude09 ) will sign up to my system in the first place. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s a large factor.</p>\n<p>However, many of my users just sign up from curiosity (you could easily just stay at level 1 and never come back again), and it seems like the majority of them are pushing forward and becoming friends with me. I think I am convinced that if my readers participate in this program, there will be more engagement, more interactions with me, and more learning from my site. Something worth checking out.</p>\n<h3>Where You Come In</h3>\n<p>The first thing you should do, especially to understand all the dynamics that I have been describing on this post, is to signup and check it out yourself. After all, if you&#8217;ve already read this entire post, why would you NOT want to connect and start playing? \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<p>Finally, as this will always be a work in progress, if you have any creative suggestions for improving the game, please leave a comment. Like everyone in this industry, I&#8217;m still learning everyday and making new experiments. If somehow you feel like this system is insulting you, is a bad method of turning intrinsic motivation into extrinsic, or anything else, let me know, and I shall be edified.</p>\n",

Before that, I was too busy running RewardMe (another Gamification related startup) to write about this passion of mine. <strong>After I stepped down as CEO of RewardMe, I finally was able to start researching and writing more about Gamification.</strong> I was really on a mission to help the world create better Gamification design, as self-proclaimed gamification experts constantly just throw PBLs (points, badges, Leaderboards) or other game mechanics on solutions without any deep game design process. As a person who is deeply passionate about Gamification, I wanted the world to give it a fair chance. I&#8217;m almost frightened that the industry will take a look at Gamification, try some badges, decide that there is no ROI, and then move on to the next shiny item. I wanted more awesome examples that move large business core metrics by double or even triple digits, whether they&#8217;re created by me or not.</p>\n<h3>The complete gamification framework: Octalysis</h3>\n<p>As a result, I started organizing and restudying all the things I&#8217;ve learned in the past 10 years to formulate the complete gamification framework &#8211; <a title=\"Octalysis: Complete Gamification Framework\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Octalysis</a>.<strong> I published the Octalysis framework towards the end of 2012, and it really took off, getting thousands of Retweets and Likes.</strong> It was also translated into over 7 languages and a big traffic driver for many reposters. Afterwards, a great amount of consulting/speaking opportunities showed up. I started working with cool companies like eBay, Gini in Germany, the Christian Non-Profit Superbook, mobile apps such as Pregnancy Companion, BeLike, and many many more to help them implement better Human-Focused Design that motivates people through the 8 Core Drives. I also got invited to do gamification talks and workshops around the world: Denmark, Australia, India, Germany, England, and of course, a variety of states in the US (my travels are documented in my video series: <a title=\"Video Course\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/video-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification</a>). All this is very exciting, especially since I just got married to an amazing wife and being able to comfortably support a family (based on what I love doing!) is always a good thing. After a year of hard work through writing, consulting, and speaking, I&#8217;m excited and humbled to be Rated 1st Place among the Top 40 Gamification Gurus in the World by UK-Based <a title=\"Gamification Gurus Leaderboard\" href=\"http://leaderboarded.com/gurus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leaderboarded</a>. Number 1 in the World? Wow, that&#8217;s unfathomable! Or as Megamind says it, &#8220;That&#8217;s without fathom!&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The craft of Gamfication</h3>\n<p>Of course, being first place on the gamification chart is mostly just an ego booster than a final accomplishment (and as the cliche but true saying goes, I couldn&#8217;t have done it without all of you guys being awesome readers, promoters, and appliers of my work). My work in this field has just begun! The way I like to put it: <strong>I have finally crafted a boat that can leave the dock and sail off to sea; and now I face the vast ocean ahead of me.</strong> There are so many things to learn and apply in gamification. I&#8217;ve said many times that gamification is not really a word I like (I prefer Human-Focused Design), but since the gaming industry was the first to master Human-Focused Design, we are now learning from games &#8211; hence &#8220;Gamification.&#8221; But gamification is not one field. It&#8217;s a combination of many (much like the study of Human Complex Systems). To continue to level up in gamification, one needs to master a combination of game design, game dynamics, behavioral psychology, macroeconomics/currencies, user experience/interface, technology, brain/happiness biochemistry (such as Dopamine and endorphins), and metric-based business systems for driving ROI. There&#8217;s so much to do, so much to learn, and so much to experience, that the gamification industry is just at it&#8217;s nascent stages &#8211; and all of that is fascinating. Of course, at one point when you are considered the &#8220;expert,&#8221; people expect you to know a bunch of stuff that others are doing. One of the hardest things to master as a &#8220;gamification expert,&#8221; is to correctly pronounce (and spell&#8230;I admit, I had to check Google for this one) the name Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, creator of the Flow Theory. Of course, everyone also expects you to know what every gamification platform (and game) is doing. &#8220;What do you think about this latest Bunch Ball feature?&#8221; &#8220;What do you think about Badgeville&#8217;s new press release?&#8221; Honestly, I&#8217;d rather go deep and study more games, psychology, and good design. But people expect me to be on top of what all these platforms are doing, so I make an effort to do that, even though new platforms and examples are popping up left and right by the dozens every week (a great sign by the way). There&#8217;s just a lot of things to learn and pick up, and I&#8217;m still at the beginning of the journey (along with the entire gamification industry).</p>\n<h3>The exciting potentials of Gamification</h3>\n<p>The most exciting potential of gamification, is that it can become the killer application for Big Data. Right now, everyone&#8217;s focused on Big Data &#8211; collecting trillions and trillions of data points in order to be able to analyze things when needed. The problem is, besides a few brilliant companies, no one actually knows what to do with that big data. They can call out reports when they want, but at the end, it becomes info-porn: fun to watch, but gets you nowhere. <strong>There is where gamification comes in.</strong> Gamification is all about utilizing big data to cater the experience to each user, making it unique and enjoyable for each person. In a game, everything is tracked &#8211; which character you choose, which stage you are on, what abilities you have learned, what items do you have, what level you are, etc etc. and based on all that tracked data, it provides you a different experience in real-time that makes things more enjoyable. Imagine if we could do that with EVERYTHING we do, where a unique and fun experience is customized for us based on big data (or what we have already done through meaningful choices). This will MASSIVELY increase engagement and retention to any application or experience out there. And whoever figures that out first will become the new Amazon (who was the first to realize and figure out the disruptive power of the internet towards traditional businesses) in a brand new era of motivation and engagement. Last, but not least: it&#8217;s nice to be First. \ud83d\ude09</p>\n",

Besides making people feel smart (Core Drive #2: Development &amp; Accomplishment), Onboarding should surface details of the game in terms of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting the scene</li>\n<li>Narrative elements</li>\n<li>Context of the actions within the games.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This post has two focuses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to really set the scene for a good Onboarding Experience</li>\n<li>How companies who are doing gamification just copy the SHELL of a game&#8217;s design but not the ESSENCE (very important topic!)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Gamification should not focus on the game mechanics but how users feel</h3>\n<p>Many of you know\u00a0my disapproval of\u00a0people who think they can just grab some elements they see from games, put it into their products, and their products will automatically be successful.</p>\n<p>EVERY single game out there has game mechanics and game elements in them, but most games still fail because of bad design. Clearly, just because you took some elements that are even found in boring games and threw it onto your product doesn&#8217;t mean your product will become successful.</p>\n<p>It depends on how you design for motivation (through the 8 Core Drives).</p>\n<h3>Gamification Campaigns that just copy the Shell of good design</h3>\n<p>When someone comes to me and says, &#8220;Yu-kai! I am creating a game! It&#8217;s going to be a ninja running around killing monsters. Is that fun?&#8221; I would respond, &#8220;&#8230;..I don&#8217;t know. It depends on how you design it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A slightly less subtle (which makes it even deadlier) sin in gamification is copying the shell of a game&#8217;s design but not the essence.</p>\n<p>What do I mean by that?</p>\n<p>Sometimes companies would see a site being very successful with a virtual economy system within it, and so they implement some type of virtual economy too that they think is the same as model. And this new virtual economy results in a colossal failure.</p>\n<p>The reason?\u00a0Virtual economies are very intricate systems, where you have to understand the anchors, input/output mechanics, rewards, tradability, labor-to-reward ratio, and much much more. It&#8217;s so easy to think that you copied someone&#8217;s solution but end up using your own &#8220;interpretation&#8221; or &#8220;creativity&#8221; and miss out on the core essence of WHY the successful virtual economy was designed that way. (This is why in Octalysis we always say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about what the game elements are. Talk about WHY those game elements are there and how do they make users FEEL!&#8221;)</p>\n<p>This is why, ironically, many games that are the most successful copy other successful ones down to the teeth! They basically switch up the graphics (like turn ninjas into frogs), or the platform (Facebook to iPhone) and become very successful, even though they don&#8217;t necessarily understand why those game mechanics are so addicting (I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of game designers now and realized a lot of them do things because &#8220;this other app does it successfully.&#8221; When I tell them about Octalysis, they respond, &#8220;Oh!! That&#8217;s why! Makes sense!&#8221;).</p>\n<p>The games that copy the Shell of a successful game, but are &#8220;rough on the edges&#8221; in turns of what they copy, mixed with some of the designers&#8217; own ideas, sometimes just fail miserably because they miss out on the essence.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Again, it&#8217;s not about what you design, but how you design it.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Lessons in Onboarding From Skyrim</b></h3>\n<p>One of my favorite places to learn about game design is the Youtube channel Extra Credits. (in order to apply to gamification &#8211; I encourage you to look into games more than you look into current enterprise examples, which only have the shell instead of the essence &#8211; we&#8217;ll discuss more on this).</p>\n<p>This particular clip is about Skyrim which helps illustrate the relationship between the SHELL and the ESSENCE during Onboarding.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/mpddXJJLhPY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Many people find Skyrim to be a very exciting adventure. It is easy to get immersed into this world and let hours go by without even realizing it. As compelling as the game is, Extra Credits points out that the experience could be improved, particularly during the Onboarding Phase.</p>\n<p>Extra Credits points out how the first 5-10 minutes is particularly important for gaining the interest of new players. This is a window of opportunity to make a powerful first impression. And the way to do this is by defining and shaping (what Extra Credits refers to as) the <i>core engagement</i>. \u00a0Throughout most of Skyrim, the core engagement is the motivation to explore and engage with a wondrous, mystical world.</p>\n<p>Within the context of Octalysis, this is analogous to the drives of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Core Drive #1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling: Being part of a journey that is beyond our own world</li>\n<li>Core Drive #3:\u00a0using creative problem solving abilities to overcome obstacles and broaden opportunities to explore.</li>\n<li>Core Drive #4: Ownership &amp; Possession: Feeling of ownership over one\u2019s journey</li>\n<li>Core Drive #7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity: Drive to see what will happen and explore to satisfy one\u2019s curiosity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The introduction of Skyrim offers very little appeal to these drives. During the initial experience of the game, players should be able to catch a glimpse of the various exploration opportunities in store for them. From a game design standpoint, onboarding story elements should be used to support the core engagement. This would help build a sense of anticipation and entice players to explore more of their journey.</p>\n<h3>Mistakes of the Skyrim Opening during Onboarding</h3>\n<p><!--more-->Extra Credit points out several areas where onboarding decisions could be improved. These include:</p>\n<p>1) Choice of the opening scene</p>\n<p>2) Physical positioning of the players</p>\n<p>3) Introducing players to the plot</p>\n<p>4) Voice acting</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, the players sit as prisoners being wheeled in a cart to be taken to their execution. Since their hands are bound, the only action available is to look around. The scene is a dreary winter landscape, which is the most unappealing location in all of Skyrim. Basically, these choices limit the core drive (#3) Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback. There is nothing much to look at, even with the player&#8217;s ability to move the head. \u00a0And certainly there is no opportunity to explore and satisfy one\u2019s Curiosity (Core Drive 7) about this world. As a prisoner, you don&#8217;t \u00a0feel a sense of ownership over your experiences and overall journey.</p>\n<p>The physical positioning of the players also works against Skyrim&#8217;s core engagement of exploration. The prisoners sit facing one another. So as they talk, your attention is completely on the other person, instead of the landscape and scenery.</p>\n<p>In the game, the opening scene makes attempts to introduce the plot. And since Skyrim was marketed to a general audience, those who are not familiar with the Elder Scroll series would have trouble making sense of the new terms that are mentioned.</p>\n<p>Extra Credit lists: Savvengard, Ulfred Stormcloak, Nord, Rorickstead, Kynareth, Akatosh, Elod, Divines, General Tuleous, Dalmore, and Helgan. The normal tendency is for people to tune out jargon, especially when there is no frame of reference available for them. Using all these names \u00a0does not serve to excite the players about the plot, or the possibility of exploring new terrain in Skyrim.</p>\n<p>Again, the initial experiences of the game are supposed to create anticipation and make a powerful first impression on new players. Therefore even small details like voice work matter. Whether it\u2019s a film or a game, bad acting can make people cringe. In the opening scenes of Skyrim, there are a couple of awkward and stilted character scenes which are somewhat cheesy, as Extra Credit points out.</p>\n<h3>Skyrim vs Modern Warfare: The Shell and Essence of the same Game Technique</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest insight Extra Credits offers in their videos is the comparison to Modern Warfare, which ties back to my theme of Shell vs Essence of a game design.</p>\n<p>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was a game launched in 2007 and had a very engaging onboarding process where the first person character is also tied up on a vehicle at the beginning, headed towards the character&#8217;s execution.</p>\n<p>During this scene, the player can also move the character&#8217;s head around to observe the environment around (since both hands are tied). The big difference is, this design setup introduced the scene, context, settings, and anxiousness of the Epic Meaning &amp; Calling (Core Drive 1) within the game. Even the head moving worked out great because the player actually feels like he is in control towards\u00a0observing\u00a0all the tension of that world, which is a small example of Core Drive #3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback.</p>\n<p>This worked out very successfully for Modern Warfare.</p>\n<p>So now comes Skyrim.</p>\n<p>In 2011, Skyrim was launched as the fifth installment of the Elder Scrolls series.</p>\n<p>Similar to Modern Warfare (and as\u00a0noted by\u00a0Ilya Bogunov in the comments, this is still in-theme of their own previous releases), during Onboarding, Skyrim\u00a0introduced a main character who is tied up on a vehicle towards his execution, with the player being able to control the camera view (neck and head) of the character.</p>\n<p>Yay, now that we do something similar to another successful game, our Onboarding is awesome right?</p>\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n<p>They just have the Shell of that technique but missed out on the Essence.</p>\n<p>As Extra Credit Explains, they missed most of the important things that Modern Warfare retained &#8211; delivering the Core Engagement, making users feel anxious, good voice acting, ability to explore the surroundings, context setting, and the ability to start caring about the topic.</p>\n<h3>Game Design Shells during Gamification Campaigns</h3>\n<p>Sometimes I face this frustration myself.</p>\n<p>Occasionally (I have learned to avoid this) some of my clients, when I am explaining some very important dynamics to them, will respond, &#8220;Okay, I get, I get it. Lets move on.&#8221; (Usually I will add, &#8220;OK. But remember, it&#8217;s VERY important that you do it this way.&#8221; And they will add, &#8220;Yea, for sure!&#8221;)</p>\n<p>I move on, and the clients start to work with their engineers and designers to create the experience I designed for them (I also do Product Managing for a handful of clients because of this very frustration).</p>\n<p>After a while, they show me what they have, and sometimes I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Wait? How come you didn&#8217;t do the Epic Meaning &amp; Calling stuff I was talking about?&#8221; &#8220;We did! See! This entire section is about Epic Meaning &amp; Calling!&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is when my heart stops a beat. It definitely has some resemblance to the experience I was designing for them, but it&#8217;s just the shell and misses the very purpose behind the design. I almost don&#8217;t want to put my name on it.</p>\n<p>To avoid miscommunications, I often create Concept Wireframes too so their engineers and designers know exactly what we want to created. However, sometimes I will learn a few weeks later that the client company decided to change a few things around because it &#8220;seemed like a good idea &#8211; this other company does it too!&#8221; and it completely broke the experience of the design.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a tough challenge to solve, and it&#8217;s hard for my readers to just read and figure out how to differentiate, but the biggest thing I&#8217;m preaching here is that you want to focus on WHY something is there, and HOW it appeals to the 8 Core Drives of Octalysis.</p>\n<h3><b>Gamification within Onboarding</b></h3>\n<p>Onboarding is the introduction of a journey. Beneath the surface lies the core structure and design. A winning game will need to revolve around a human-focused design which appeals to the core drives of the player.</p>\n<p>The Octalysis framework helps to serves as a reference for applying these drives to forge the essence of the game. Without a strong essence, the story, characters and other surface elements will not create a compelling experience.</p>\n<p>In the case of Skyrim, the opening introduction is lackluster compared to full array of experiences that are later made available to the player. I believe this could have been improved by integrating various core drives at the very beginning and using onboarding elements to support this design.</p>\n<p>I agree with Extra Credits who suggests subtle inclusions of visual story elements (e.g. brief exposure to some of the exciting landscapes in Skyrim) to help players feel excited about exploring this fictional land.</p>\n<p>Engaging core drives within the opening scene would certainly help improve the experience of the first twenty minutes. Players should be able to get a sense of a vast, larger world and the potential for their new adventure, even if they are bound in a cart.</p>\n<p>But once the player gets past the bleak introduction phase, the real allure of the game takes\u00a0place.</p>\n<p>Does your Gamification Campaign focus on the Essence or the Shell?</p>\n<p>(<em>Thanks to Christine Yee for tremendously helping me on this post!

I was thinking about just suddenly one-day update my blog with a new look and surprise a lot of people, but at the end, I decided to go with the lean-startup way of getting user feedback and adjusting towards a final good product.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about updating the design of my blog for a while now. This theme has been around for 5 years and it&#8217;s not completely SEOed up. I also wanted something that stands out more and is more memorable, more immersive and game-like. I wanted something that people can explore too.</p>\n<p>So I ran some analysis of my own blog. I&#8217;ll write about this later, but for every gamified campaign, the first thing I tell my clients to do is to define the following (I call this the Strategy Dashboard):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Business Metrics -&gt; Game Objectives</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Users -&gt; Players</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Desired Actions -&gt; Win-State</strong></li>\n<li><strong>User Metrics -&gt; Stats</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Incentives -&gt; Carrots</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>For my own blog analysis, I won&#8217;t boggle you down with the details, but for two of the items above, I determined</p>\n<h3>Business Metrics for my Gamification Blog (based on order of importance)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Consulting and Speaker Engagements</li>\n<li>Contact Form Submissions</li>\n<li>Go to Octalysis Post</li>\n<li>Watch Videos</li>\n<li>Comments</li>\n<li>Share on Social Networks</li>\n<li>Unique Serious Visitors</li>\n<li>Passive Revenue</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Desired Actions for my Gamification Blog (Based on Chronological Order)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Go onto site through interesting content</li>\n<li>Comment on the blog</li>\n<li>Get to Octalysis Post</li>\n<li>Get to Video Guides</li>\n<li>Get to About Me Page and Consulting Page</li>\n<li>Signup to the Captain Up widget on the right</li>\n<li>Click on Contact Form</li>\n<li>Complete Contact Form</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Thinking behind new Gamified Blog</h3>\n<p>My new blog had a few goals. The first goal is to get people to go onto my Octalysis post. From my Google Analytics, I see that anyone who goes onto my Octalysis post has by far lower bounce rates, higher time-on-site, and higher return chances. This basically means that if I wanted engaged users, I need to pipe them into my Octalysis as much as possible. As you can see, I&#8217;m also incorporating more of that into my current design.</p>\n<p>The second goal is to get people to start watching my Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification Video Series. At the beginning, this started off as a hobby project (and I had no idea how busy I would be these days so I gave myself an ambitious goal), and even though it was fun to show friends and colleagues, I&#8217;ve been a bit self-conscious about it, as it may be too non-serious/goofy to show potential enterprise clients.</p>\n<p>If you have been following the series, you know that in the episodes where I&#8217;m getting beat up by alien lobster creators, I&#8217;m going down a snow slope while trying to teach gamification, and there&#8217;s even an episode where I sing a cover song that is entirely about how awesome I am (lyrics goes: &#8220;Yu-kai Chou &#8211; he&#8217;s my hero! Gonna take boringness down to zero!&#8221; And yes, great for laughs between friends, but I&#8217;d always thought this would deter me from getting new clients.</p>\n<p>So for a while, I hid my videos on my site so average visitors won&#8217;t find them.</p>\n<p>However, after a while, I noticed that even though less than 5% of my site visitors watched my video, more than 50% of the people who reached out to me for consulting have watched the videos, which shows that, if anything, they do not hurt my chances of getting consulting gigs (and may even help!). As a result, I want my new users to see my video.</p>\n<p>The third goal is to make sure people recognize who the author of the site is. More often than not, people would browse through a bunch of content, learn from it, and not realize who the author is. Since part of my goal for my site is personal branding, I think it&#8217;s crucial that people recognize who I am. Perhaps, that&#8217;s also the reason why my videos convert well &#8211; I ascend from pure information into a personality.</p>\n<h3>Implementation Plan for the Gamification Blog</h3>\n<p>So the idea I had was to do a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an immersive experience through a futuristic city (sort of like being in a game)</li>\n<li>Every element should be something relevant to the city</li>\n<li>My main blog content should be an LED screen on a building (sort of like New York Times Square)</li>\n<li>My video should be a TV Screen or billboard in the city, and it either will show the latest video, or perhaps a live show I&#8217;m putting on at the moment.</li>\n<li>The Octalysis post should be the sun on top (and is the most abstract shape/concept in the chart) so people would want to click on it.</li>\n<li>The sidebar should also be a side building with a variety of content on it</li>\n<li>My picture and bio should be another object in the city, primarily a blimp that is pulling a big banner ad.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m experimenting with icon-based navigation menus to add a bit of fun into the process. You won&#8217;t know exactly what it is at the beginning, but eventually you might get curious \ud83d\ude09</li>\n<li>Instead of having a box that talks about my Twitter followers, it would be cool if the twitter bird sits on top of the screen and talks to the reader. Sometimes I can even put in messages like, &#8220;Yu-kai&#8217;s new book is coming out!&#8221; or &#8220;Live show happening in 9:29)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Original concept design work for the Gamified Blog</h3>\n<p>A lot of people ask me what I actually do for clients. Well, besides helping them define the 5 things mentioned above in the Strategy Dashboard, run an Octalysis audit through the Discovery, Onboarding, Scaffolding, and Endgame Phase, adding improvements/suggestions based on the 8 Core Drives, refining everything down to a feature list based on the effectiveness and difficulty scores, I also help clients create concept wireframes so their designers/engineers know exactly what to build.</p>\n<p>Below is a &#8220;concept&#8221; wireframe I made for myself. I passed the below as the original concept to my designer, and after 7 reiterations, we finally reach to what you see above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gamified-Blog.012.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3508\" alt=\"Gamified Blog\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gamified-Blog.012.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gamified-Blog.012.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gamified-Blog.012.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Personal Blindspots for the Gamification Blog</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, when it comes to designing my own stuff, especially when it&#8217;s something so personal with my face all over the place, it&#8217;s hard to be objective. I feel like I have a lot of blindspots because I want a very vibrant and rich world where users can explore and enjoy the experience of browsing through a variety of content (I have a lot of interesting/cool ideas coming up&#8230;)</p>\n<p>However, I also often tell my clients that they need to be very clear on the &#8220;desired actions&#8221; towards the users&#8217; &#8220;win-state.&#8221; If a user CAN do 20 things, they end up feeling decision paralysis and end up doing nothing. I had a feeling I was straying away from my own advice, so I made some tough decisions to cut out some really cool but complex ideas.</p>\n<p>Still I feel that the new design might be too complex for someone newly on the site. At the same time, my own credentials are very small. I feel like a new user who has not seen this a thousand times would feel overwhelmed by all the stuff that they can interact with. This is usually fine in a virtual world, but I have not tested this in a content website.</p>\n<h3>Fresh-Eyes Feedback Please?</h3>\n<p>I would love to get some feedback from all of you before I commit resources to engineers to build this out. I also might take this post down once I have decided and the development work starts (so hopefully for some other readers this will still have some element of surprised \ud83d\ude09 ). Please let me know if you have any concrete advice and suggestions that I can take before having a developer build it.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Right now I&#8217;m still covering the basic foundation of Octalysis Level 1 and a bit of Level 2 to my audience, just across different platforms: blogposts, Beginner&#8217;s Guide to gamification video series, Workshops, and an upcoming book. Even though through each medium you are learning something a little bit different, it helps you really nail in the 8 Core Drives and 4 Experience Phases, which is the center of my Octalysis Framework.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a joy to receive a lot of emails from people all over the world, either thanking me as they are using Octalysis regularly for their own products, or that they are teaching their students or clients this framework. My goal is to really proliferate this framework as much as possible (without really thinking about how to monetize), so the Gamification industry as a whole can really be boosted away from superficial and non-meaningful designs.</p>\n<h3>Five Hour Talk in 25 Minutes</h3>\n<p>Needless to say, my framework on Octalysis can go VERY deep, and I have done 5-hour workshops of this, while still not covering all the depth of this topic to make it fully realize its actionable potentials. Shrinking it to 25 minutes most scratches on the surface of the topic, but hopefully with my upcoming book &#8220;Actionable Gamification: Beyond Points, Badges, and Leaderboards&#8221; things will be much more deeper for my audience.</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun!</p>\n",

Bitcoin is the new, hot &#8220;virtual currency&#8221; that is not only attracting the attention of millions of individuals, but banks, the federal government, state governments, and a number of national governments. And importantly, the attention of venture firms &#8211; companies like Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Union Square Ventures, which have all recently invested in Bitcoin-based start-ups.</p>\n<p>Oh yea, some of you are busy. Before continuing with the hype of Bitcoin, here is a summary of the things you should know about It.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bitcoin is a secure digital currency, created by computers &#8220;mining&#8221; complex mathematical problems.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>There is a mathematical limit of 21 Million Bitcoins that can EVER exist</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Even though there are already over 11M Bitcoins mined in the last few years, there is diminishing marginal return on mining, and so experts expect it will take another 100 years before all 21 Million of then are mined out.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Because Bitcoins can be permanently lost, hence destroyed, (and it happens regularly on accident), the existing Bitcoins will never be close to the 21 Million max.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Almost ALL kinds of businesses are trading with Bitcoins now, online and offline: from gambling sites to your local barber or dentist.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Due to true scarcity, diminishing marginal returns on mining, and a growing sense of trade ubiquity, it is quite possible for a Bitcoin to be worth $10,000s or $100,000s in value. (Of course, it is also possible for it to drop to $0)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Okay, back to the hype story of Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>In April Tim Draper, founder of Silicon Valley&#8217;s Draper Fisher Jurvetson, led a seed-funded investment in CoinLab, itself a Bitcoin business incubator. Shortly after it secured a series A round of $6.11M. Winklevoss Capital Management (yes, the twins from the Facebook story), submitted a filing with the SEC in July, in a bold step to launch the first Bitcoin ETF (exchange traded fund). Estimated to own 1% of all Bitcoins, the twins plan to commit the entire stash to the fund, establishing a roughly $13,000,000 base. And now, even Google Ventures has entered the fray with its small seed investment in OpenCoin, the developer of an open source payment system for virtual currencies.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin promises to be the democratic currency for the common man, yet a great investment vehicle (not without unpredicted risks) for those &#8220;smart&#8221; VC&#8217;s in the Valley and other investors around the world. At the same time Bitcoin millionaires have been created, who are naturally interested because their accounts cannot be frozen or seized, at least for now.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3406\" alt=\"Bitcoin_icon.sm\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?resize=100%2C100&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3>So, What is Bitcoin?</h3>\n<p><strong>Bitcoin is a virtual (digital) currency network, though more specifically a &#8220;cryptocurrency&#8221; network, where the creation and transfer of value is based on an open-source cryptographic protocol that is independent of any central authority</strong>. The term &#8220;bitcoin&#8221; also refers to the basic unit of currency within this system. Born in 2009, the network is global &#8211; allowing currency to be moved between countries almost instantaneously without involving government regulation or control by traditional banking systems.</p>\n<p>Bitcoins are generated from a process of mathematical mining, which is used to secure the network. <strong>However, instead of yielding a unit of gold or silver, this process yields an encrypted string of data, known as a hash, equal to a unit of virtual currency</strong>. All bitcoins are generated (mined) and all transactions are tracked (secured) by a global network of peer-to-peer computers using standard Internet protocol.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3406\" alt=\"Bitcoin_icon.sm\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?resize=100%2C100&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Why Bitcoin is special.</h3>\n<p>There are a number of fundamental features which make bitcoins and the Bitcoin network attractive to users. Some reflect the characteristic qualities of the more traditional &#8220;quality&#8221; currencies, while others are distinctive to cryptocurrencies. Here are some of the more compelling features which make Bitcoin unique:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Decentralization &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nInstead of traditional government oversight and banking control, the Bitcoin economy is monitored and maintained by its global network. This global network provides a means to support, verify and secure the comprehensive public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. No government, company, or organization runs the Bitcoin network &#8211; it is fully distributed among its users.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Anonymity &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nThough all transactions are public, they are not tied to one&#8217;s identity. Therefore, each and every transaction is not only secure but anonymous &#8211; the user controls anonymity and traceability. They protect their privacy.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Security &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nThe system is highly encrypted and secured by a global network of computers which check every transaction for uniqueness, to insure that no coin is reproduced or double spent. This essentially makes bitcoins impossible to counterfeit.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Public &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nThere is a comprehensive public ledger which tracks all transactions &#8211; the &#8220;block chain&#8221;. While this enables every transaction to be viewed in public, the parties involved remain undisclosed.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Stability &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nThe supply of bitcoins is predetermined and coded into the encrypted network. This prevents the random or indiscreet &#8220;printing&#8221; of money into the system. This makes Bitcoin more attractive as a long term store of value, or eventual investment vehicle.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Convenience &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nBitcoins are carried in a digital wallet. These wallets can be located on your computer, smart phone, an iPod Touch, or in the cloud. The amount of bitcoin is not restricted by physical size. You can carry thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins onto a plane or dining out without a problem. And they are invisible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Frictionless &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nPoint to point transactions are, in general, free of any charges. Individuals can use Bitcoins in direct exchange for products and services &#8211; no transaction fees or bank charges. In this sense it&#8217;s like cash. For large transfers, online retail purchases, or exchange services &#8211; such as purchasing dollars with bitcoins, the service fees are normally a small fraction of what banks and money handling institutions would change for Fiat currencies. In these cases, bitcoin is essentially frictionless.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Market Growth &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nLast but not least, Bitcoin has exploded in the past year, from a market cap of some $50M in 2012 to over $1.4B in 2013. Exchanges rates for bitcoins were as little as a few cents per coin in 2011 to $20 in 2012, and are now hovering around $120 in 2013. Though the future is still unpredictable, the bitcoin has shown increased price stability with time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3406 alignright\" alt=\"Bitcoin_icon.sm\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?resize=100%2C100&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What makes Bitcoin special among virtual currencies.</h3>\n<p><!--more-->Typically we can think of virtual currencies in two classes &#8211; company-based virtual currencies and true cryptocurrencies. In the first case, the virtual currency is intrinsic to a single entity and therefore limited to its exchange for products and services offered by that entity. Think of Linden Dollars used in Second Life or Amazon Coins, which can be used for purchases within the Amazon stores. Outside of the their parent entities, these currencies offer little if any exchange options. For supporting purchases and transactions in the global digital world, Bitcoin is vastly superior.</p>\n<p>In the case of the true cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was the first and is the current darling in the virtual currency world. Though Bitcoin is a viable purchasing currency for online products and services, it is also beginning to gain acceptance by restaurants and stores in the physical world. Many professionals will now take bitcoins in exchange for their services. (You can even have dental work done on your teeth, but right now you&#8217;ll have to fly to Finland to do so.)</p>\n<p>In general, only Bitcoin has gain a reasonable level of public acceptance. Though there are a least two dozen notable cryptocurrencies, only a handful have gained even a modest level of traction. Litecoin, which is actually based on the Bitcoin protocol, is set up to have 84 million coins mined. Currently about 20% of these have been mined, with a total market value of $50 million. Unlike Bitcoin, there are no physical merchants that are currently accepting Litecoin. However, there are a growing number of online services that do accept Litecoin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3406\" alt=\"Bitcoin_icon.sm\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?resize=100%2C100&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Where is Bitcoin on the Hype Cycle?</h3>\n<p>The Bitcoin hype may not be over. In fact, it may still be growing. At a recent MIT/Stanford Venture Lab (VLAB) event on virtual currencies, moderator Kashmir Hill of Forbes indicated that the &#8220;hacker community&#8221; was actually excited about two technologies and weren&#8217;t certain as to why. First was 3D Printing, and the second was Bitcoin. You may be familiar with other technologies that have &#8220;excited&#8221; this community &#8211; like the World Wide Web and Social Networking.</p>\n<p>At the same VLAB event, Cameron Winklevoss stated that he felt that most people probably know about Bitcoin by now. However, statements about technological awareness from the high tech centers often over estimates reality. What might seem like common knowledge in Silicon Valley, LA, New York, Boston, or Austin, may not be the norm for the rest of the country. Or the world for that matter, though Europe and parts of Asia and South America seem to lead Americans&#8217; awareness in the case of Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>A recent June YouGov/Economist poll of 1000 US residents found that only 30% responded yes to the question &#8220;Have you ever heard of Bitcoin?&#8221; This seems to contradict Cameron&#8217;s statement, though one could argue that the sample size may have been too small or that it weighed rural areas too heavily. He may have also been implying a more global awareness.</p>\n<p>Another poll of over 22,000 U.S. consumers was taken on Bitcoin in May by the survey firm On Demand. They found that only about one quarter (25.3%) of Americans had heard of Bitcoin. In comparison to the company&#8217;s surveys taken in Argentina and the UK, Americans seem to lag in awareness of the virtual currencies. Results in those countries were closer to one third &#8211; 37.9% (on a sample size of 760) for Argentina, and 32.3% (on a sample size of 2,731) for the U.K. For the Bitcoin-aware responders, the trust of the currency by Americans (62%) also lagged that of the Argentinians (73%) and the British (69%).</p>\n<p>It is debatable on where Bitcoin is in terms of the Gartner hype cycle. For those unfamiliar with the Hype Cycle, it is a visual tool used by analysts to help evaluate the maturity, adoption, and social impact of specific technologies. Typically, a new technology goes through a phase where there is great excitement, leading to inflated expectations. This is followed by a subsidence phase, and a subsequent maturing and recovery, in becoming a viable product or service.</p>\n<p>Some may argue that the Bitcoin system and technology is approaching the &#8220;Peak of Inflated Expectations&#8221; as it continues to garner an increasing number of stories in the news. Some might say it is already descending from the peak, which might become more apparent in hindsight, a few months into the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gartner_Hype_Cycle.2.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3408\" alt=\"Gartner_Hype_Cycle.2\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gartner_Hype_Cycle.2.jpg?resize=300%2C195&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gartner_Hype_Cycle.2.jpg?resize=300%2C195&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Gartner_Hype_Cycle.2.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Others, the optimists among us, probably feel that Bitcoin has passed the inflated expectations stage and negotiated the &#8220;Trough of Disillusionment&#8221;, and is now moving up the &#8220;Slope of Enlightenment&#8221;. They point to rapid mid-year rise of Bitcoin daily trading in 2011, from volumes around $10,000 to a peak of over $250,000. This is illustrated in the two year daily volume chart for Mt. Gox (Chart reproduced courtesy of bitcoincharts.com). The chart presents the daily volume in US dollars. With the accompanying decline, the resulting profile did approximate a rough early Hype Cycle profile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MTGox2yvolchart.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3409\" alt=\"MTGox2yvolchart\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MTGox2yvolchart.png?resize=300%2C111&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"300\" height=\"111\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MTGox2yvolchart.png?resize=300%2C111&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MTGox2yvolchart.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>Mt. Gox Daily Volume in Currency &#8211; USD from Aug 31, 2012 to Aug 31, 2013. BitcoinCharts.com.</small></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The subsequent rise in trading did suggest that Bitcoin could actually be on a trajectory that might seem like a slope of enlightenment in nature. However, fitting Bitcoin trading data to a Hype Cycle is more an art than a science. Can you see how the period from March through August looks like it might be exhibiting Hype Cycle characteristics? Well, try harder. Alas, predictions will only be validated after a substantial amount of time has passed. We may have to wait awhile until we know where Bitcoin is on the Hype Cycle.</p>\n<p>In terms of daily transactions, <strong>Bitcoin has risen over the last year from typical days of 30,000 transactions to typical days in excess of 60,000</strong>. At the same time estimated transaction volume has increased from $5M to $30M. Both trade volumes and transactions continue to rise.</p>\n<p>Though it is impossible to know the actual number of people involved in daily transactions, the number of unique digital wallets used can be tracked. Typically 30,000 unique wallets were used a year ago. The current daily wallet numbers are near 70,000, with occasional days where the number exceeds 100,000. If we were to assume that there is an approximate 1 to 1 ratio of people to active wallets involved in transactions, this data would indicate overall adoption is steadily rising.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BC_Rnd_64px.1.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3410\" alt=\"BC_Rnd_64px.1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BC_Rnd_64px.1.png?resize=168%2C64&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"168\" height=\"64\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Who and what accepts Bitcoin.</strong></p>\n<p>All types of online services accept payment in bitcoins &#8211; from computer hosting and Internet service providers to online merchants selling everything from electronic supplies to nerdy tee shirts. You can even buy flowers through a growing number of online florists.</p>\n<p>Online casinos, travel agencies, professional services, gift shops, software suppliers, and of course, many porn sites use Bitcoin. Some notable companies have adopted Bitcoin early on, such as WordPress &#8211; which started accepting bitcoins in late 2012. The Internet Archive, the non-profit foundation which historically preserves websites through the Wayback Machine, started to accept donations in Bitcoin in early 2013. Not only accepting bitcoins, but paying its employees in bitcoins if they prefer. This organization is becoming a Bitcoin trend setter, not only for foundations, but possibly all businesses in general.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/De_Waag_Bitcoin.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3412\" alt=\"De_Waag_Bitcoin\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/De_Waag_Bitcoin.jpg?resize=300%2C225&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/De_Waag_Bitcoin.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/De_Waag_Bitcoin.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Slowly but surely restaurants and cafes are beginning to accept Bitcoin. Draper University in San Mateo, CA is now accepting Bitcoin for tuition payments and course fees, and other institutions may follow. Similar to their online brethren, some consulting services are beginning to adopt a Bitcoin-friendly business position. And of course, their are those dental services in Finland. As adoption becomes more prominent in the US, this may lead to a trend in American dental services. And if dentistry, why not plastic surgery and other elective medical services?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3406\" alt=\"Bitcoin_icon.sm\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?resize=100%2C100&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>How Bitcoins are produced and circulated.</strong></p>\n<p>There are a number of mathematical features in the design of the Bitcoin system, which provide rather unique desirable qualities. <strong>First, the total number of bitcoins that will ever be produced is set at 21,000,000 coins. Currently there are a little over 11,000,000 bitcoins in existence.</strong></p>\n<p>The actual generation of new bitcoins comes as a bounty or reward for closing the ledger, roughly every ten minutes. <strong>The production of bitcoins decreases over time, as the reward value is halved every four years.</strong> Originally the reward value started at 50 coins &#8211; producing 50 bitcoins every ten minutes. Currently it is 25 bitcoins, in 2017 it will be 12.5 bitcoins.\u00a0<strong>At this rate the total 21,000,000 bitcoins will have been produced by the year 2140.</strong></p>\n<p>Concurrently, the difficulty in mathematically solving the cryptographic problem which is used to verify the transactions and secure the network, will increase. This increased difficulty will require more computing resources and electrical energy to be invested. As such, the reduced rate of production and the increased computing investment is part of what gives Bitcoin its value. (Not gold, silver or the good faith of governments.)</p>\n<p>One should be aware that the total number of Bitcoins in circulation will never be 21,000,000.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wait, didn&#8217;t you say that a total of 21,000,000 Bitcoins will have been mined?&#8221;</p>\n<p>That is true, but Bitcoins can also be destroyed. This is because some people will lose their wallets. Without the wallet and the private crypto key, the Bitcoins inside can never be recovered. Similar to losing cash in a fire, but without insurance to cover the lose, and without new printed money replacing old and offsetting the effect on circulation.</p>\n<p>It is also speculated that some users have accumulated large sums of Bitcoin, with the intent of holding them for the appreciation in value. This effectively removes them from circulation, essentially creating a condition of pseudo-destruction. If the user meets with an unfortunate situation, such as chronic memory loss or demise, without provisions for a suitable execution of assignment to another individual or entity, the state of the coins is that of permanent destruction. Kiss them goodbye.</p>\n<p>All in all, these Bitcoin characteristics &#8211; theoretical limitation on the total number of coins, the increased difficulty in mining (production of coins), the decreasing reward for mining coins (and securing the network), and the residual destruction of coins, create anti-inflationary forces. These forces will make it hard for Bitcoins to decrease in value over time. They may also have a stabilizing effect on the coins in the exchange markets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3406\" alt=\"Bitcoin_icon.sm\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?resize=100%2C100&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Types of Bitcoin Businesses/Companies.</strong></p>\n<p>There are many types of Bitcoin-based companies. Most are normal, legal businesses, but a few are illegal, or at least somewhat notorious. The great majority are services, retailers or markets, while a few deal with actual Bitcoin products &#8211; the Bitcoin miners. We&#8217;ll touch on a few here.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Marketplaces &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nThere are two marketplaces which use Bitcoin for transactions, Bitmit and Silk Road. Bitmit is an online auction site that conducts its sessions in dollars and bitcoins. Bidders and sellers can post their orders in either, and the updates will be displayed in both. Like eBay, there are &#8220;buy now&#8221; options where the purchase price is given in both dollars and bitcoins. For each transaction a 1.9% service fee is charged, whether in bitcoin or dollars. Though these fees are far from frictionless, they are seen as reasonable in exchange for the convenience of purchasing products with bitcoins.</p>\n<p>Silk Road (established in early 2011) is a rather infamous online &#8220;black market&#8221; site known for supporting the purchase and sell of drugs. Though users can purchase legal goods and services, an estimated 70% of the products are drugs. All transactions are conducted with bitcoins. This takes advantage of the anonymity that Bitcoin provides to protect the identity of the clients.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Financial Services &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nOn the financial services side, there are a number of Bitcoin monetary exchanges, led by the largest &#8211; Mt. Gox. Based in the Tokyo district of Shibuya, Mt. Gox was established in 2010 and trades bitcoins for dollars, yen, euros, and other currencies. Mt. Gox typically charges a fee up to 0.6% on each trade. Typical trading volumes are around $15M a month. Other exchanges include BitInstant, Virwox, BTC-e, and BitStamp, who together represent about a third of the volume of Mt. Gox.</p>\n<p>One precious metals exchange is based on bitcoin &#8211; Coinabul, a two year old company based in Wyoming. The company sells gold in bars or coinage, and silver coins, for bitcoins. Once payments are received through the network and secured in the Coinabul digital wallets, the purchased gold or silver is distributed from its centers in California.</p>\n<p>Another financial service for Bitcoin is Bitpay, the automated payment processing service for bitcoin. Bitpay enables online merchants to accept bitcoin payments in exchange for a 1% service fee. As Bitcoin gains acceptance more merchants will utilize Bitpay as a purchase option for their customers and take advantage of the lower service fees &#8211; relative to credit cards and other charge services. In the future an similar system is expected to support physical stores and merchants who would like to offer their customers the option to make bitcoin purchases.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gaming &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin gaming sites, most are gambling sites or have substantial wagering features. The leader is SatoshiDice, the online Bitcoin site which started in January of 2013. Since then a number of gambling parlors and casinos, such as Bitcoin Video Casino have been launched which feature wagering in bitcoins. Many existing casinos have opened up their wagering options to include. One unique feature of some Bitcoin gambling sites is the acceptance of very small bitcoin bets, typically on the order of a few cents in value. It&#8217;s a good way to test the waters before going in too deep.</p>\n<p>Like the standard online game universe, MMORPG&#8217;s, puzzles and gameboard games are beginning to appear. It appears that most are retools of existing games, but featuring Bitcoin purchase options. In time this segment of games may catch up to the gambling segment</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mining Hardware &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nA number of Bitcoin miner companies have developed in the last couple of years. These hardware-based companies build the computers which secure the Bitcoin network and solve the math to compete for the coin reward that is generated every time the ledger is closed. Since these computers must compete to see which can close the transaction ledger first over each ten minute interval, those with greater computing power are more likely to win.</p>\n<p>In the early days of the network desktop PC&#8217;s and laptops could be used. The faster machines, with the more powerful CPU&#8217;s would be highly competitive. Soon GUP cards were installed and tapped to do the mining, outperforming the machines which used their CPU&#8217;s. Shortly thereafter people would build rigs which utilized multiple GPU cards. These rigs would generate &#8220;hashing solutions&#8221; much faster, but would also consume large amounts of electrical energy. They also produced excessive amounts of heat &#8211; good for the winter, but not the summer.</p>\n<p>In the past year, specialized mining rigs (advanced miners) based on advanced chip designs have come to market. One type uses application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips to do all the heavy lifting. Another type uses field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips to do the number crunching. Both types offer major jumps in performance over GPU-based rigs, with ASIC machines being the fastest for now. However, the cost of designing, developing and manufacturing these rigs can be substantially higher than just purchasing a fast PC and loading it with hefty graphics cards.</p>\n<p>All of the advanced miners are either project builds &#8211; developed and supported by user groups, or start-up companies, such as Butterfly Labs, Avalon, and Avnet. But the start-ups are not without controversy. Many purchasers have experience delays in delivery, or uncertain fulfillment &#8211; orders placed and funds committed, with product put on hold. Customer support has been characterized as unpredictable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Six Advanced Miner Companies</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">FPGA &#8211; based miner companies: Avnet, Butterfly Labs, Lancelot<br />\nASIC &#8211; based miner companies: Avalon, Bitforce, Block Erupter</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mining Pools &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nAnother type of Bitcoin business based on miners comes in the form of mining pools, which take various forms. In one form, individuals that own miners can join a grouped pool, where all rigs work together over the Internet, in a combined effort to win the bitcoin reward for solving the blockchain (transaction ledger). Since the combined computational power of the pooled network is much more substantial, the likelihood of winning is proportionally greater. If the pool wins, the Bitcoin proceeds are stored in a pool wallet and distributed to each member proportionally, based on the amount of computing power they bring to the pool.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mining Contracts &#8211;</em></strong><br />\nAnother form of pooling is offered through pool contracts. Companies like Cloudhashing use powerful clusters of bitcoin miners to do the mining and sells contracts to both individuals and companies. As the cluster produce bitcoins, the contract owners are paid out based on the level of their contracts. This eliminates the need to own expensive hardware, configure and maintain sophisticated software, and supply the electrical power to run the equipment. It also provides the essential on site monitoring and maintenance around the clock, which insures that mining is always being performed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3406\" alt=\"Bitcoin_icon.sm\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin_icon.sm_.jpg?resize=100%2C100&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3>What is the Future for Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>It appears that we are entering a new era for the world&#8217;s currency systems. In the beginning currencies were commodity based. Items and materials of perceived value became accepted in exchange for other items (products) and services. Eventually gold and silver became the accepted common backing for most societies.</p>\n<p>Subsequently commodity based systems were replaced by the politically based systems, where the &#8220;good faith&#8221; of governments became the backing. In the twentieth century the US dollar replaced gold as the basis of all currencies. Everyone knew that the good faith (and power) of the American government backed the dollar &#8211; so it had to be like gold. In theory, it was the US Fiat currency that helped to supported other Fiat currencies.</p>\n<p>But today the US dollar is more virtual than it has ever been. Most of an individual&#8217;s wealth is the form of electronic records stored in their accounts with various financial institutions. Many more transactions and simple purchases are made through electronic services than through the physical exchange of cash or coin. The virtual nature of money is ever increasing.</p>\n<p><b>So, as the &#8220;usage&#8221; of bitcoins continues to increase, while the creation rate of bitcoins continues to decrease (a few years to mine half of the coins, and over 100 more years to mind the other half!), at some point in the future each bitcoin could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars!</b></p>\n<p>Still, there are inefficiencies and expensive mechanisms which prevent many of the advantages of a virtual currency. The developers and supporters of Bitcoin believe that the new digital currencies will help solve the remaining problems, with Bitcoin leading the way.</p>\n<p>At its current rate of adoption, Bitcoin is expected to become a viable alternative to Fiat currencies in the next ten years. Sooner, if adoption does not stay somewhat linear, but takes on a more typical exponential rate. It already exceeds the total value of the currencies of some smaller countries, such as Niger, Sierra Leone, Bhutan, Samoa, and Liberia.</p>\n<p>Some critics have accused Bitcoin as being a network of Ponzi schemes, while others have claimed it will be a refuge and vehicle for criminals and money laundering. But the same arguments can be placed on the Fiat currencies and their supporting financial systems. Yes, Bitcoin might be used for money laundering, but have you ever thought of how much money goes through Wells Fargo to be laundered?</p>\n<p>What Bitcoin does bring to the table is a highly secured transaction network that can globally transfer money faster than Fiat-based systems. And a system that protects an individual&#8217;s privacy, which is a very sensitive and hotly contested subject on its own.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we can look back at the history of the last forty years. In the early seventies IBM executives felt that small home computers weren&#8217;t a viable concept &#8211; &#8220;no one would want a computer in their home&#8221;. Two young men from Silicon Valley felt differently.</p>\n<p>Though computers had been linked together, exchanging data since the late 1960&#8217;s, no one thought it would have much practical benefit for society in general. When we learned to do the same thing without wires in the 1980&#8217;s, it was still viewed as a novelty. But along came the 90&#8217;s and the world became different, in a connected sense.</p>\n<p>Networks, social networks, mobility, entertainment and education, among others, are evolving to make lives more dynamic and effective. But as far as our currency systems have advanced, they are still slow in evolving &#8211; especially in security and privacy. Virtual currencies may be the solution, or part of the solution. And Bitcoin, with all the debatable issues, appears to be poised in leading the way.</p>\n<p>(Special Thanks to Jerry Fuqua, the Bitcoin expert, for tremendously helping out on this post and making it possible!)</p>\n",

Are you one of them? The game is currently more popular than every other game on Facebook, including mega-popular ones like Words With Friends, Farmville, and Angry Birds.</p>\n<p>So what makes the game so addictive and leaves players clamoring for bonuses like new episodes, extra lives, and charms and boosters?</p>\n<p>The answer is actually quite simple. King has implemented aspects from all of the 8 Core Drives of the gamification design framework Octalysis into their game, and those drives work together to create an incredibly addictive experience that is currently earning over a million dollars every single day thanks to in-app purchases.</p>\n<p>How are they hooking you, exactly? Let&#8217;s look at each of the core drives of Octalysis and see how Candy Crush Saga implements each one.</p>\n<h3>Game Core Drive #1: Epic Meaning and Calling</h3>\n<p>Unlike most games, Candy Crush Saga does not have a particularly compelling narrative that, on its own, convinces the participant to take action. True, you ride a little train solving problems in the magical world, but it&#8217;s mostly just funny problems such as helping a magical dragon bathe in candy, which is not a very strong &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this because it&#8217;s a mission bigger than myself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Instead, the epic meaning and calling comes from game techniques such as Beginners Luck, Destiny Child, and getting a Free Lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>Players experience Beginner&#8217;s Luck \u00a0(Game Technique #23) when they start the early levels, which allow them to easily get three stars for matching candies and crushing them.</strong></p>\n<p>As they continue playing, many players can go through the first 10 levels and get three stars on each on the first try. This makes them think, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m pretty good at this \u2013 I should keep playing.&#8221; <strong>They feel like they are destined to take this journey and see how far they can get without losing lives.</strong></p>\n<p>As they progress even further through the levels, players start to unlock charms and boosters that give them extra moves, special abilities, and cool new ways to crush candy. Now, eventually they&#8217;ll have to pay for these terms and boosters, but initially, they get 1 to 3 freebies that they can use during the game. <strong>This is the Free Lunch (Game Technique #24) that makes them feel like they are getting bonuses due in part to their performance.</strong></p>\n<p>Almost every addicted player feels these three mechanisms during the on-boarding process, which is in the first 35 levels. Not surprisingly, these first 35 levels are free and help players get acclimated to the game before the levels start costing money.</p>\n<h3>Gamification Core Drive #2: Development and Accomplishment</h3>\n<p>Candy Crush Saga, like most Facebook games and iPad apps, uses tons of rewards to show progress and demonstrate accomplishments to the player. As I mentioned before, on each level players earn up to three stars and also get a score based on how many points they earned throughout the level.</p>\n<p><strong>There are also Fixed Action Rewards (Game Technique #7) built into the game.</strong> The most obvious one is that if you beat a level with at least one star, you&#8217;ll unlock the next level. Of course, the next level is just another puzzle to figure out (an intrinsic motivation that ties to Core Drive #3), but the tangible reward is in the accomplishment of progressing through the map, which shows one long, continuous train track. The player always knows where she is on the track and always knows the next action she needs to take in order to move forward.</p>\n<p>One of the most important things in any game design is to make sure the user isn&#8217;t stuck for too long. This is where they introduced the<strong>\u00a0Glowing Choice (Game Technique #28).</strong>\u00a0When the player doesn&#8217;t make a move within 10 seconds, Candy Crush Saga will offer a hint that appears to have no rhyme or reason. The goal of this is just to make sure no one is stuck at any point for too long without finding any next steps at all.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the iPad app allows you to connect to Facebook, which automatically connects you to all your friends who are playing the game. <strong>At the beginning of each level, you&#8217;ll see a Leaderboard (Game Technique #3) which includes where you rank amongst your friends.</strong> The leaderboard gives you all sorts of metrics you can try to achieve, including what your friends scores for that level. This motivates players because they can see their own progress against their friends&#8217; scores, stars, leaderboard positions, and number of levels beaten or progress within the game (This of course leans heavily on Core Drive #5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness too).</p>\n<p>Finally, Candy Crush Saga is divided into episodes, most of which have 15 levels each (the first two episodes are the only ones with 10 levels). <strong>The last level in each episode is almost always the hardest and simulates the Boss Fight (Game Technique #14) that is typical of traditional video games like Mario Brothers or Donkey Kong.</strong> Beating this last level lets the player progress to the next episode, which gives players a huge sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<h3>Gamification Core Drive #3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback</h3>\n<p><!--more-->Each level of Candy Crush Saga arranges the candies in a random order, which means that no two boards are quite the same. This allows players to use their own creativity to come up with the right combinations that will help them beat each level. When they create a cascade of matches, the game rewards them with words like, &#8220;Tasty!&#8221;, &#8220;Sweet&#8221;, and &#8220;Delicious!&#8221; This lets the player know that they are racking up points with each move.</p>\n<p><strong>The game also uses Step-By-Step Tutorials (Game Technique #9) to show players how newly introduced concepts work.</strong> These tutorials are incredibly important, especially during the on-boarding process, because they empower players with the confidence to learn by doing things and practicing the skills they just learned on their own.</p>\n<p>Finally, because the game is almost entirely based on unlocking new levels, new boosters, and new episodes, <strong>there&#8217;s always a General&#8217;s Carrot\u00a0 (Game Technique #11) dangling in front of them, which engages them to push forward through the game.</strong></p>\n<h3>Gamification Core Drive #4: Ownership and Possession</h3>\n<p>Candy Crush Saga uses a few forms of ownership and possession to help their players, though they could easily add more of this drive to the game. <strong>The primary Virtual Goods (Game Technique #8) within the game are the charms, which are special candies that can be used between 1 to 3 times on any level once activated. </strong>These candies are good throughout the entire game, so even though they often run between $25-$50, players are happy to collect them and use them on the more difficult levels that they are having a hard time beating.</p>\n<p>The way Candy Crush Saga gets players is by bringing the opportunity to purchase those charms and boosters outside of the &#8220;shop.&#8221; At the beginning of each level, they show you exactly which charms and boosters are allowed on the level and fade out the ones that you haven&#8217;t collected (purchased) yet. They present the charms and boosters as a small set of three or four so it looks like you have one but not the others. <strong>This makes players want to purchase the others to complete their Collection Set (Game Technique #16)</strong>, because who doesn&#8217;t want to have tons of boosters to use on a specific level?</p>\n<h3>Gamification Core Drive #5: Social Influence and Relatedness</h3>\n<p>Candy Crush Saga makes use of Facebook&#8217;s platform to spread the word about their game. <strong>When you open the game in your browser, the first message you&#8217;ll receive is a Friend Invite request (Game Technique #60), asking to invite friends to play the game too.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Candy Crush Saga also uses Social Treasures (Game Technique #63) as a way to get you interacting with your friends on the game.</strong> There are a number of social treasures you can give your friends at no cost to either you or them. These include helping them unlock an episode, giving them free lives, and giving them three extra moves that they can use on any level of their choosing. These gifted bonuses cost money within the game, making them especially valuable virtually and in the real-world. Because there&#8217;s no cost, this encourages players to help their friends by sending them these coveted items.</p>\n<p>But Candy Crush Saga takes it even a step further because it also allows players to send requests to their friends for these free items. For example, to unlock an episode, you can either pay $0.99 or you can get help from three of your friends. There&#8217;s a built-in mechanism to send requests to your friends whenever you need help unlocking in episode or gaining extra lives.</p>\n<p>Finally, the game&#8217;s use of leaderboards and the map allow you to see how far your friends have progressed throughout the game. <strong>While there&#8217;s no mechanism specifically for Bragging\u00a0(Game Technique #57) to your friends, it&#8217;s easy to start a comparing yourselves with others either on points, stars, or number of episodes unlocked (which is Touting).</strong> <strong>This can also create a subtle sense of Envy (Game Technique #59), drawing the player into wanting to be more like their high-achieving friends.</strong></p>\n<h3>Gamification Core Drive #6: Scarcity and Impatience</h3>\n<p>One of Candy Crush Saga&#8217;s most frustrating points is that they only give you five lives \u2014 and when you lose one, it takes you 30 minutes to gain it back. That means that if you play a level and lose it five times, you have to wait roughly 2 1/2 hours before you can play again. <strong>This use of the Fixed Interval Torture (Game Technique #66) leaves players with an incredible sense of impatience to get back to the game.</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, you can buy another set of five lives\u00a0as an in-app purchase if you don&#8217;t want to wait. But there are other ways to get more lives as well, like through asking your friends or by connecting your Facebook account to as many mobile devices as you want. The game is available on the iPad, the iPhone, and most android phones, each of which will start your lives back at five, which means players are often switching between multiple devices in order to keep playing.</p>\n<p>This gives Candy Crush Saga incredible penetration in the mobile market, which means that players have the game at their disposal while they&#8217;re out waiting in lines, riding the train, or stuck in traffic. This just encourages more and more opportunities for play until the player has developed an addictive habit to keep them going with the game.</p>\n<h3>Gamification Core Drive #7: Curiosity and Unpredictability</h3>\n<p>Even though the concept behind Candy Crush Saga is simple, it&#8217;s a surprisingly unpredictable game. The most obvious unpredictability is that each time you open the level, the candies are arranged in random order. That means that some configurations will make the level of easier to beat than others, which has players going through the level over and over again in rapid succession until they beat it.</p>\n<p><strong>Additionally, as a player gets into the later levels, there are tons of Sudden Rewards/Easter Eggs (Game Technique #30)</strong> <strong>in the form of special candies. </strong>The player has no idea what special candies they might get when they start a new level, which keeps the game fun and fresh.</p>\n<p>After a number of episodes, the game literally introduces Easter Eggs, which are a type of candy that, once matched, turns into a particular handful of special candies. When a player matches an Easter Egg, there are both random rewards and random penalties, because the Easter Egg can either turn into a special candy or a molasses trap, like a chocolate bite or metal twists, both of which make it more difficult to play level.</p>\n<h3>Gamification Core Drive #8: Loss and Avoidance</h3>\n<p>The last core drive, loss and avoidance, is also used in Candy Crush Saga. When a player connects to Facebook, all other players they are friends with can see how many days they have been stuck on a particular level. <strong>This Scarlet Letter (Game Technique #82) can make it socially unappealing to not move forward in the game.</strong> Candy Crush Saga also encourages players to connect to Facebook from their mobile app because Facebook syncs their progress. <strong>If you don&#8217;t sync up, and you lose your phone or break your iPad, then through Lost Progress (Game Technique #81), you&#8217;ve lost all the effort you&#8217;ve invested into the game and will have to start over from the beginning.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The game also makes use Weep Tunes (Game Technique #49) and Visual Graves (Game Technique #47) to give negative feedback when you lose a level.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, this game is based on tons of levels that take between three and five minutes to play, each. This means that an avid player can easily work through 100 levels in a couple weeks. <strong>This engages the Last Mile Drive (Game Technique #53) where the player keeps on playing because they&#8217;re so close to the goal and they&#8217;ve already invested too much time and energy in the game to quit.</strong></p>\n<p>But are they that close to completing the game? King continues to add new episodes to the end of the map, which means the players can keep going for awhile. The longer they play, the harder it is to stop.</p>\n<p>So now that we&#8217;ve been through the eight core drives of gamification and how Candy Crush Saga utilizes each of them to hook players into returning for more and more levels, can you see why this simple game has swept the nation?</p>\n<h3>Learning from Game Mechanics of Candy Crush</h3>\n<p>Candy Crush sure did a good job appealing to the mainstream consumer and getting them to pay comfortably on an app. Our goal here is not to make sure we can make good games, but to make sure we learn from the game design and dynamics so we can provide it into useful and productive tasks within Gamification.</p>\n<h3>What appeals to you the most about Candy Crush?</h3>\n",

How else can I get your attention?). Instead of just expecting my readers to just sign up and vote, I thought I would write a post to talk about how I decided on the messaging.</p>\n<p>Many of you are probably familiar with South by Southwest. Some of you may have heard about it, or watched video clips from previous years. Others of you may have actually gone there before. And there may be those of you who have never heard of it, or are unclear about what it is.</p>\n<p>South by Southwest (SXSW) is a major yearly event in Austin Texas that is composed of different festivals representing the best of the digital interactive world, music and film. It started back in 1987 and has continued to grow in its popularity.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/btvBu_ejnxQ\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Gamification &#8211; SXSW 2014</h3>\n<p>For SXSW 2014 (which will be held next spring) I\u2019ve decided to enter the running to be a speaker on Gamification and Octalysis. But to earn this privilege, I will need your votes.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on my site, you probably have the understanding that gamification lies beyond trends, fads and gimmicks. You\u2019ve heard me mention over and over on how it is Human-Focused Design (instead of function-focused design) that can really motivate people towards tedious tasks and make them fun.</p>\n<p>Having this perspective voiced at SXSW would surely inspire the creation of more meaningful and socially uplifting experiences through the power of thoughtful game design. Here are two panel picker pages that I have created so far.</p>\n<p><b>Actionable Gamification: Beyond Points, Badges &amp; Leaderboards (writing a book on this topic)</b>\u00a0<a title=\"Gamification sxsw\" href=\"http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/20636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/20636\u00a0</a></p>\n<p><strong>How Gamification Can Bring Back Desires to Learn</strong>\u00a0<a title=\"Sxsw Gamification\" href=\"http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/20765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/20765</a></p>\n<p>On a personal level, your vote would be a huge favor to me that I intend to honor.</p>\n<h3>Game Design Decisions behind the HelloBar Ask</h3>\n<p>So, as I was designing the hello bar at the top, I thought about which core drives would be most applicable to those who might vote for me. Not to be didactic, but as you may know by now, I&#8217;m here to teach about human-focused design and the 8 Core Drives, so it&#8217;s appropriate for me to discuss my thinking behind things.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about what type of message would be best for my audience in the short sentence on the Hello Bar (very limited spacing), especially for a pretty annoying action of signing up to a new site (it redirects you to somewhere else!) and then voting.</p>\n<p>I thought about Epic Meaning &amp; Calling, where people who are passionate about Gamification (and doing it better through Octalysis) might want the world to know more about it, so possibly a &#8220;Help GOOD gamification spread by voting for me!&#8221; message may work. But still, most people aren&#8217;t as passionate about &#8220;spreading good gamification&#8221; as I am, even if they love coming to my site and learning from it (I&#8217;m seeing many people who have visited my site HUNDREDS of times&#8230;yea that&#8217;s right, weirdo).</p>\n<p>I thought about a small combo of the Thank-You Economy from Core Drive #5, and a combination of Core Drive #4 and #2, saying something like, &#8220;If you can think of 2 useful things you have learned from my site, it would be great if you can vote for me.&#8221; Since it should be relatively easy for people to think that they learned 2 useful things on my site (note: studies have shown that if you say, &#8220;Can you think of 10?&#8221; people will give up after 4-5 and then have a NEGATIVE opinion of you or your brand just because they couldn&#8217;t complete the challenge), they self-qualify and may have a higher tendency to vote (they also feel ownership over their acquired knowledge). But that&#8217;s still like a &#8220;Hey, you need to pay me back&#8221; kind of feel, which I don&#8217;t like.</p>\n<h3>Social Influence &amp; Relatedness (#5)</h3>\n<p>At the end, I went all in with Core Drive #5 with Social Influence &amp; Relatedness, making this message very personal and from my heart. Even though by trade I&#8217;m a professional in motivational design (but still an early student in this nascent field!),\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">I sincerely feel blessed to have such loyal readers and followers who regularly post their feedback and show their enthusiasm.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>For my quick HelloBar message, I use my own personal voice and directly ask for a vote to help ME. I make it very clear that this is a BIG favor to me and that I will appreciate it a lot if you do help out. I reiterate that value by saying &#8220;I owe you one&#8221; at the very end when space is very tight.</p>\n<p>This feels different than saying, &#8220;You learned from me before, now you need to return the favor.&#8221; This is more like, &#8220;Please help me, and I will owe YOU one.&#8221; The feeling of &#8220;I&#8217;m awesome. I&#8217;m a nice person, and now Yu-kai Chou owes me a favor.&#8221; is much better and motivating. In fact, I&#8217;ve received a few emails from people I don&#8217;t know saying, &#8220;Hello Yu-kai. I voted for you today. I need some advice about gamification and was wondering if we could talk for 30 minutes about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even though these &#8220;free time commitment&#8221; emails I&#8217;m usually a bit slow on responding (despite truly wanting to help), I immediately responded to all the people who said they voted for me and gave them all the support I can.</p>\n<p>I think that getting people to feel really comfortable reaching out to me for a favor return is actually a good result &#8211; it breaks the comfort zone barrier of talking to me because now people feel like they have EARNED the right to do so, and so they want to claim the REWARD they deserved, instead of thinking, &#8220;Hmm, he&#8217;s probably really busy so I don&#8217;t want to bother him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This helps tremendously towards making my site more social (and helping me build more meaningful relationships with my community).</p>\n<h3><!--more-->Ownership &amp; Possession (#4)</h3>\n<p>Another thing to note is that I made sure that within the message, the &#8220;favor&#8221; included the words &#8220;Sign Up and Vote.&#8221; This is important because if I just said, &#8220;Please do me a favor by voting!&#8221; People at this point might make a mental commitment to just vote, but once they go onto the site, they will see that they need to do the 7 second registration and then abandon the mission altogether because it was more than what they expected.</p>\n<p>I wanted people to see at the beginning that they are committing to both signing up AND voting, so when they decide to click the link, they are prepared to sign up for something they probably didn&#8217;t care about. This gives people clear OWNERSHIP to what they committed to (Core Drive #4). I felt that adding the extra 2 words is pretty important, or else I would have gone for a shorter and simpler message on the bar.</p>\n<h3>Social Treasure: the game technique SxSW uses to market itself (Game Technique #63)</h3>\n<p>For SxSW, what they are doing is very clever and drives a ton of motivation. SxSW has successfully established itself as the big go-to place for tech, online media, and startups. In fact, during the few days it&#8217;s going on, dealmakers in this space stop taking meetings (outside of Austin, TX that is), and you have to explain to others why you are NOT going to SxSW.</p>\n<p>For that, they have slowly built up some Epic Meaning &amp; Calling (Core Drive #1) into the process, similar to what Burning Man, the World Cup, The Olympics, or TED has done. This means that many people go because they &#8220;should&#8221; go, since they are part of the industry and that&#8217;s what people in the industry do.</p>\n<p>They have built up such strong meaning in their conference, that just for this year alone, there were 3,000 speaker submissions to the interactive design sessions and 750 speaker submissions to the education ones.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s A LOT of speakers!</p>\n<p>And so, for speakers to differentiate themselves, the event organizers introduced a game mechanic I call the &#8220;Social Treasure&#8221; (which is Game Technique #63 in my secret stash of game mechanics and techniques). <strong>A Social Treasure is something that you can only obtain by having SOMEONE ELSE give it to you.</strong></p>\n<p>When you play Farmville, there are some items that you can&#8217;t earn by yourself. You can&#8217;t even buy with real-money! But the only way to get it is to have a friend give it to you for free, and somehow it&#8217;s just created out of thin air. Of course, you can give your friend one for free too. And because of this social treasure mechanism, a few years ago everyone&#8217;s spamming your Facebook wall, saying, &#8220;Please send me a goat!!&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t even play Farmville!&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s okay! You can just created an account and I can give you a goat too!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8230;&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the most common form of a Social Treasure in the online world right now is the Vote. By requiring other people outside of the system to vote for players, it automatically needs to be viral. If all 3,750 speakers go out and solicit votes, then that&#8217;s A TON of free promotional value for SxSW (ever thought why they have become so successful in the first place? These are clever people)</p>\n<h3>Choice Perception (Game Technique #89): Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback</h3>\n<p>Another important mechanic here is what the vote mounts to. According to SxSW, the votes only contribute to 30% of the final decision. 40% are from the Advisory Board, and 30% from the SxSW staff. I think that&#8217;s clever design, because it gives people the Feeling of Choice, or Choice Perception.</p>\n<p>At the beginning stage on any game (Onboarding, which is Phase 2&#8230;this post is probably more understandable by those who are more familiar with my Octalysis system&#8230;.) <strong>you need to show users if this is a game worth playing.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Lets say they just say that this is completely based on votes &#8211; 100%. Now, people may get upset over this and think, &#8220;Well, this is just a stupid popularity contest. I don&#8217;t have time to ask for votes all over the place,&#8221; and they don&#8217;t do anything.</p>\n<p>Frankly, I&#8217;ve done those 100% vote-based campaigns once, and I decided to not do that again. My whole team worked our butts off, annoyed a bunch of friends, just to get the &#8220;chance&#8221; to present somewhere. We felt manipulated a little bit, because we HAVE to get our friends to vote to play.</p>\n<p>However, in this case, they specifically tell you &#8211; since voting only determines 30% of your eligibility to speak at SxSW, you still may get picked without soliciting votes, so it is up to you if you want to do it.</p>\n<p>Now the dynamics of the game has changed a little bit. Instead of saying, &#8220;Harassing your friends IS the game,&#8221; it&#8217;s now, &#8220;You can still play and win without harassing your friends, but it would be a strong bonus IF you did invite your friends.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now it FEELS better! It&#8217;s a game worth playing because I&#8217;m already awesome and judges and staff members will likely pick me, but I&#8217;m even super powered up more if I get my friends to vote!</p>\n<p>This switched the Core Drives from Loss &amp; Avoidance (#8), &#8220;I&#8217;m only getting votes because I don&#8217;t want to lose,&#8221; which is a great bottom-line motivator but not for sustaining engagement (like how I never wanted to do that again) to Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback (#3) and Development &amp; Accomplishment (#2). Now people think, &#8220;Cool! Let me see HOW I can get people to vote for me and increase my chances even more!&#8221;</p>\n<p>And even though, *sigh*, you probably still don&#8217;t have THAT much of a choice, you have the perception of choice, which makes you commit the Desired Actions towards the Win-State.</p>\n<h3>Believability and duality in a monetization engine</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Again, 30% is an important number to communicate, because it feels more real and more believable. I&#8217;ve seen events that say, &#8220;You will have a voting competition, but at the end it will be based on the judges to pick who wins.&#8221; That actually creates the OPPOSITE effect (now you see why Human-Focused Design is so intricate? Takes a lot of time to learn and study&#8230;).</p>\n<p>The reason why this creates the opposite effect is that now I&#8217;m either thinking, &#8220;OK&#8230;.so I can work my butt off, but still get nothing??&#8221; or, &#8220;They say that but I don&#8217;t believe them. It&#8217;s going to be all about votes anyway.&#8221; And that again, leaves a bad taste in the mouth and people may not want to engage for the long run (again, it might work well in the short-run with some Black Hat Gamification tweaks&#8230;wow, this is probably the most technical post on Gamification I&#8217;ve written in a while).</p>\n<p>You see this in games also &#8211; they will give you a choice: either spend money now and get all this awesome stuff, OR, spend 200 hours playing and eventually earn them. If the game just locks the items until you pay for them, users might feel that this is lame and the developers are greedy and just want to steal money. If they just give out all the stuff for free, users feel a sense of Abundance (instead of Scarcity, which is Core Drive #6), and they might not work as hard doing the 200 hours tasks.</p>\n<p>But when you give them a choice between both, a lot of users feel, &#8220;Hey! I can save $3 by doing this [ridiculously long task that will take 200 hours to do]! That&#8217;s awesome! Let me start now!&#8221; Now doing those tasks has &#8220;value&#8221; in them, even the hourly rate they are saving is pretty pathetic.</p>\n<p>Eventually the user realizes that too. &#8220;Wait a second&#8230;if I paid $3, I can save 100 hours of my time! That&#8217;s a no-brainer! I should do that!&#8221; and so now they don&#8217;t feel like the game developer is greedy and stealing their money for a gated garden. There is still a free path into the gated garden, but now you can pay and get in quickly! Woot!</p>\n<p>The user ends up doing both the Desired Actions, AND paying money. AND they felt that just got a great deal. And none of this would have been accomplished if the game didn&#8217;t give them the Perception of Choice.</p>\n<h3>The quickest example of this in the non-game world is Dropbox.</h3>\n<p>Dropbox says, &#8220;Either you can get more space by inviting more users, OR, you can pay money now and get space immediately.&#8221; A lot of people, including me, started inviting friends to join Dropbox to get more space. In my case, I eventually felt, &#8220;Well, I need a lot of space since I back up my entire hard drive on Dropbox, but I don&#8217;t like to harass my friends, so I think I&#8217;ll just pay money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lo and behold, I ended up inviting my friends AND paying for space in dropbop.</p>\n<p>Anyway, because SxSW clearly states that it&#8217;s 30%, it feels legitimate, transparent, and every action I take feels like I am building a bonus, instead of</p>\n<h3>GG, South by South West</h3>\n<p>Just even in my case! I&#8217;m always already screaming for a lack of time. I went to bed 3:30AM yesterday morning and woke up 7AM this morning. Some clients are still waiting for me to deliver some work, and my wife has been feeling I have been working too much. And what do I do? I spent a lot of time working out the perfect promotion interface (finally picked HelloBar and customized it), thought about my messaging quite a bit as you can see, and even wrote a blogpost about it when I could be writing my book or making a new video!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve clearly fell for their game technique here. I think we should create an industry jingo, where when you significantly changed your behavior because of Human-Focused Design, you should say, &#8220;GG, South by Southwest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GG stands for &#8220;Good Game&#8221; in the gaming community, and is most commonly used when one just lost a game against an opponent. It&#8217;s a good display of good manners and appreciates how the opponent demonstrated good abilities and outplayed the player.</p>\n<p>Of course, in this game, if you have changed your action a lot based on a gamified campaign, you are also recognizing that they have created a &#8220;good game&#8221; to which you started to participate in. I think the alternative to GG is the word &#8220;Touch\u00e9,&#8221; but it&#8217;s just not used much in the gaming world so a bit more off-theme, so I&#8217;ll stick to GG.</p>\n<p>Oh yea, and GG Dropbox&#8230;.GG.</p>\n<h3>If you have read up to here, please vote for me</h3>\n<p>Alright.

Since its introduction in 2001, continuous feature development and improvement has made it a powerful and reliable resource for businesses.</p>\n<p>Despite this, its adoption rate has be painfully slow in most cases. Many organizations find that their employees often prefer to minimize their use of the platform, or ignore it completely. In fact, a 2011 Forrester report indicates that 31% of Sharepoint companies have users that still prefer collaborating via email.</p>\n<h3>The Badgeville Webinar</h3>\n<p>Enter Badgeville to address this situation with game mechanics. With Badgeville for Sharepoint the intent is to engage users and have them adopt the different Sharepoint features in a meaningful way to promote collaboration. By integrating smart gamifying elements into the Sharepoint structure, Badgeville enables companies to influence and reward key user behavior, and improve knowledge sharing, resource management and collaboration. This in turn increases the likelihood of valuable actions and performance, providing positive results derived from the initial investment. (Wow, that sounds effective.)</p>\n<p>In a recent Badgeville webinar (July 10, 2013), Chris Lynch, Badgeville&#8217;s Director of Product Marketing, explored ways to improve Sharepoint adoption through the use of gamification techniques. Featured in the program were Joel Olson, the Managing Director at Salient6 , a Sharepoint consulting firm, and Caroline Dangson, a key producer at Badgeville.</p>\n<p>Chris kicked off the seminar with a quick survey, polling the listeners on what they use SharePoint for &#8211; which functions they have deployed. (Listeners were allowed to check any and all of nine possible responses.) The results indicated how diverse their use was.</p>\n<p>The three leading functions were Site (portal, intranet) (71.5%), Collaboration (58.1%), and Content Management (57.0%). At a more modest level of deployment were the internal-facing Custom Apps (26.3%) and Social (19.0%) functions. At still more modest levels were Insight, consisting of business intelligence and analytics (8.9%), and external-facing Custom Apps (8.4%). (Some listeners responded that they have deployed an unspecified function(s) (7.8%) or none at all (17.9%).)</p>\n<h3>The Sharepoint Adoption Challenge</h3>\n<p>Joel initiated his part of the session with comments about the objectives of Salient6&#8217;s efforts to unlock business value for SharePoint, by enhancing the user interface and user experience through game mechanics. But there are challenges. Both Forrester Research and Gartner Research have reported that despite over $1B being spent annually on SharePoint, adoption has been slow. Only about 40% of the &#8220;line of business&#8221; users regularly use SharePoint, with a full 41% of all users preferring more standard tools such as email. Not surprisingly, 51% of all users don&#8217;t like the user experience.</p>\n<p>To explore this further, Joel initiated a second quick survey of the listeners to poll them on what they felt were the main adoption challenges.</p>\n<p>The results point out some key problem areas which have previously been identified. In February 2013, Forrester Research released the report, \u201cSharePoint Enters Its Awkward Teenage Years&#8221;, which stated that despite great strides in development, it has been a disappointment in several areas. Specifically, in these four areas:</p>\n<p><strong>Adoption</strong> &#8211; lack of forethought in rolling out SharePoint to regular users</p>\n<p><strong>User Experience</strong> &#8211; the user experience with SharePoint has proven cumbersome and confusing</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong> &#8211; people still love the experience of familiar apps, such as email, despite the advantages of SharePoint&#8217;s integrated features and the efforts of third party developed apps, such as harmon.ie</p>\n<p><strong>Business Value</strong> &#8211; 40% of the survey respondents indicate their organizations are not seeing business value from SharePoint adoption</p>\n<p>In the survey results, the lack of enthusiasm for the user experience clearly stands out and confirms the findings from Forrester. Also the preference for other (more familiar) tools and the lack of obvious business value for users seems to support the earlier findings. (Note that the survey results reflect the exclusive nature of the polling &#8211; listeners selected only the &#8220;Biggest Adoption Challenge&#8221;, not challenges. If the survey would have allowed listeners to select multiple challenges, the cumulative impact would be more obvious.)</p>\n<p>The survey results also indicate that the learning curve presented a significant challenge to users. This would obviously affect the user experience, providing little incentive to move away from more familiar apps and tools, and ultimately impairing the rate of adoption.</p>\n<p>Joel noted that though IT can deliver the latest and greatest, users will often just turn their backs on new solutions. Especially when there is little support in training or encouragement for adoption. So, if IT just deploys a new application or platform and expects the users to employ it in their daily routine, certain disaster awaits. In fact, often the IT team itself is without the skills needed to understand what can be delivered and what potential benefits can be derived from the SharePoint platform. (He implied that this is a lack of business understanding on IT&#8217;s part, for what is possible.)</p>\n<p><strong>Digging Deeper into the Problem</strong></p>\n<p>Joel further focused on three points for evaluating an adoption situation &#8211;</p>\n<p><strong>Engagement</strong> &#8211; it&#8217;s not just about getting people to use the solution. If that were the case, you could just put the time keeping app on the intranet homepage. (This would get nearly 100% of your users to use some part of the platform, but it does solve the true &#8220;engagement&#8221; challenge.) They need to really become involve &#8211; actively engaged.</p>\n<p><strong>Community</strong> &#8211; Users need information, training, help, and assistance. Building community increases knowledge sharing. He suggests starting an in-house SharePoint User Group, to find the SharePoint leaders and champions. They will in turn share with others and help in the adoption process, benefiting the community and the organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Loyalty &amp; Expertise</strong> &#8211; Your SharePoint team won&#8217;t scale by itself. You need to reward and recognize successful efforts on the part of the power users and champions in business. Encouraged, they will increase their efforts and evangelize the adoption of SharePoint.</p>\n<p>To do all of this, Joel encouraged the use of a gamifying strategy. By illustrating personal examples from his Delta Frequent Flyer program, LinkedIn profile strength, and FourSquare badge collection, he demonstrated that participation is recognized and rewarded. And that is a very powerful motivator for most people.</p>\n<p>With SharePoint 2013, the Microsoft product group recognized that gamification makes a difference in communities and in contributions. One can look at the community settings and see that reputation is built in. You can see and set reputation levels &#8211; how many points you get for the different accomplishments and tasks. Ratings result in different reputation points, with the quality of input and interaction affecting point acquisition.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the reputation feature that has been built into SharePoint 2013 stops at the community level. The great effort to build recognition for who is contributing and encourage participation doesn&#8217;t transfer across communities. So, if you have multiple web applications, it is challenging &#8211; and it doesn&#8217;t actually interact with your team sites.</p>\n<p>Joel&#8217;s member page shows when he joined and his reputation score (as a Top Contributor in the SharePoint 2013 community). It also shows him how many points are needed to move to the next level &#8211; &#8220;Earn 318 more points to move to the next level&#8221;, a very nice feature.</p>\n<p>Joel presented Yammer as another example of game mechanics being effectively employed in a SharePoint environment. The SharePoint Yammer community, which is on top of Yammer, is a group of over 3,000 users, which was established in 2012. An app enables selected users to view leaderboards inside of Yammer. This allows one to not only see who is active, but who is contributing the most quality. It effectively identifies the leaders and champions.</p>\n<h3>The Cooperation between Badgeville and SharePoint</h3>\n<p>As the focus switched back to the collaboration between Badgeville and SharePoint, Chris Lynch explored some of the details of the gamification platform that is built on top of SharePoint. The discussion of how gamification elements are applied to the various instances of SharePoint starts from a functional level. (Caroline Dangson would later present the design perspective.)</p>\n<h3>Identifying Key Behaviors</h3>\n<p><!--more-->The first step is to identify what types of key behaviors need to be encouraged and rewarded. These might include the creation and editing of documents, posting or responding to a blog, viewing pages, and rating content, among others. These key behaviors may not touch on the &#8220;shinny and exciting&#8221; SharePoint features, but because of the ultimate benefit, are important to encourage anyway. All will be based on company priorities.</p>\n<h3>Points</h3>\n<p>Within the Badgeville platform one can edit and modify which behaviors they want to encourage and what corresponding point values can be assigned. Chris suggested that static activities which involve little effort might be assigned a low point value, while more demanding activities receive proportionally higher point assignments.</p>\n<p>Caroline noted that many times users are not competitive and a point-based game mechanic may not be effective in influencing the desired behaviors. She emphasize that this is not a problem. Though points are the most common game mechanic, they are certainly not the only element that can be used in building an effective gamification design.</p>\n<h3>Levels and Achievements</h3>\n<p>The use of levels is an example of a non-competitive game mechanic that could be used inside SharePoint to encourage certain types of productive behavior. Consider all the SharePoint sites within a company, each containing content and processes that are related to a particular functional area. Within each area employees will want to become more proficient in functions that are relevant to them. That is, they will want to &#8220;level up&#8221; and gain expertise in specific company functions. For example, in the sharing of best practices on the customer service wiki, one may want to &#8220;level up&#8221; to become more effective in customer interaction, producing efficient and enjoyable sessions.</p>\n<p>Another example would be the use of achievements, where users could be rewarded not with points, but with specific achievements for certain accomplishments. A &#8220;Commentator Achievement&#8221; would be appropriate if an individual were weighing in on specific pieces of content with effective comments and opinions.</p>\n<h3>Missions</h3>\n<p>Achievements can be employed as distinct motivators in specific areas or modules, or in a broader sense to larger, comprehensive programs known as missions. A mission will consist of a number of goals or milestones which employees can meet within a certain period of time. This period could be short term, such as a week, or long term, taking up an entire year. The planner(s) of a mission will want to consider what important goals need to be established, and how to visually guide their users along a certain, desirable path.</p>\n<p>In the earlier survey on SharePoint&#8217;s biggest adoption challenges, some listeners indicated that it lack certain key features. However, it is generally felt that SharePoint has plenty of key features. What seems to be the problem is that users aren&#8217;t aware of these features or else it&#8217;s not obvious which ones to use. Missions can help to guide them along a path of usage and make it clear which features can be used in an effective way inside the application.</p>\n<p>By performing the mission tasks through a guided path, each user can gain familiarity with the key features, and become more accomplished with SharePoint. However, missions don&#8217;t have to be prescriptive and always lay out a path in a specific order. Many individuals like to explore, and would find a sequential structure limiting or even boring. Mission planners should then provide some variation and choice in how users could elect to pursue the mission, possibly focusing on features that have a particular interest to them. In essence, providing a number of ways to achieve the desired goals and gain rewards and recognition.</p>\n<h3>Leaderboards</h3>\n<p>Another game mechanic that Badgeville has helped to build inside SharePoint applications is the use of leaderboards. However, planners have to be rational about their use and consider the context with which they are employed. For instance, leaderboards could be used to display points obtained for activities that span the entire corporate intranet, which in general would not be very interesting for most people. The leaderboards would only attract the attention of those individuals that are already deeply invested in the use of SharePoint and its features, the &#8220;hyper-adopters&#8221;.</p>\n<p>What would probably be more interesting to all the other individuals would be leaderboards that are tailored to their specific area. That is, boards that are tallying points that result from those activities in their department, their area. They would be interested because it relates to their job function and daily involvement. Something that they would more likely strive for.</p>\n<h3>A Survey of Webinar Listeners&#8217; Gamification Plans</h3>\n<p>A third survey was initiated to see what the listeners were thinking in terms of their SharePoint gamification plans. The great majority (72.3%) were in the learning phase, to explore the possibilities. A modest segment indicated that they were planning a project within the next six months (18.8%), while a small segment indicated they were planning a project beyond six months (4.7%). For those that indicated that they have SharePoint projects implemented, some said that they were optimizing (2.6% of total surveyed) or expanding in 6 months (1.6% of total surveyed).</p>\n<p>The results seem to indicate a cautious approach on the listeners&#8217; part. Still uncertain about SharePoint, with or without gamification. The majority may still be grasping to understand the potential benefits of the platform, if gamification can reduce the risks.</p>\n<h3>Considerations for Designing an Effective Gamification Plan</h3>\n<p>Now that we know it is possible to apply game mechanics to improve user engagement and enhance the SharePoint experience, what is an effective way to approach the situation? Here, Badgville&#8217;s Caroline Dangson swings our focus over to the design side. She points out that though it&#8217;s very easy for a company to take an experience and simply add on the game elements alluded to above &#8211; points/achievements, levels, leaderboards; the pitfall is that it often doesn&#8217;t integrate them into the experience seamlessly. Poor design is the significant reason why 80 percent of gamification applications will fail to meet business objectives by 2014, according to the Gartner report published in November, 2012.</p>\n<p>To avoid these hazards, one must focus on the total user experience &#8211; understanding the users, their activities and their environment. The users can be thought of as an audience, so it is important to understand them before different game elements are employed and how these might be implemented. For example, if your &#8220;audience&#8221; is not competitive, leaderboards will offer little interest or reason for further engagement. In fact, they will actually dissuade people from wanting to engage and cause them to avoid participating in the experience.</p>\n<h3>Motivational Factors</h3>\n<p>The smart way to approach gamification is to tap into the key elements of human motivation. In general, gamification emphasises elements of positive psychology to encourage positive behavior. So let&#8217;s look at the key intrinsic and extrinsic motivators for promoting this.</p>\n<p>Intrinsic motivation is felt from within. For example, one wants to feel smart, successful, socially valued, and appreciated. If by their actions and contributions, they receive acknowledgement, move up a leaderboard or a level, receive points, or obtain a badge, they can feel good about themselves. They may also fell better about how they fit in as a member of the community. In each case the quick, positive feedback encourages them to stay engaged and increase their involvement.</p>\n<p>Extrinsic motivation, though not necessary in a social context, can be implemented in a corporate environment. Many companies actually merge their corporate incentive programs into the gamification system. Thus, employees may be rewarded with gift cards or material rewards once they obtain certain achievement levels. Though a general euphoric feeling may result from these external rewards, it is not like the intrinsic motivators that people start with.</p>\n<h3>Motivation Mechanics</h3>\n<p>Because the concept of motivation is so important here, we may even think of this more in term of &#8220;motivation mechanics&#8221;. From this perspective, Chris and Caroline felt that the builders of an effective implementation must strive to support key elements in their design:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Recognition and Positive Feedback:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Deliver achievements and instant feedback for users who perform valued behaviors</span></li>\n<li><strong>Learning and Improvement:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Elevate user rank, status and expertise</span></li>\n<li><strong>Social Reputation and Status:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Surface key people, and behaviors and achievements with activity streams</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us look at some examples of how motivation mechanics might be employed. We&#8217;ll look at motivating collaboration, learning (video learning), and compliance.</p>\n<h3>Motivating Collaboration</h3>\n<p>What about collaboration? How do we get employees to work together and collaborate to provide better results, as in the case of knowledge management? Using motivational factors again, we can encourage individuals to not only contribute content, but to share expertise, exchange ideas, and cooperate on improving the overall quality.</p>\n<p>From a design perspective, a content provider may not be able to earn the desired achievement or points until others in the community have validated the value and quality level. Others may review, tag, comment, and edit the original content, potentially receiving feedback, acknowledgement and rewards for their efforts. As the validation is developed, the original author gets instant feedback and is rewarded for their work.</p>\n<h3>Motivating Learning</h3>\n<p>To help employees learn and promote new products, companies can use SharePoint to drive videos on learning content. This enables them to keep their sales and marketing reps current through product videos. Since it is very hard to have their reps stay current on all the products and product information, videos have been found to be an effective solution as a learning program.</p>\n<p>In one case a Fortune 500 technology company used SharePoint as the supporting structure for providing the video content of its learning program. Game mechanics were integrated into the system to show user progress and whether they were staying current. The social context of activity streams was also important for this implementation because it showed what users were doing. Though it can introduce a level of social pressure, it can also help to address issues with the content and identify areas that need to be addressed.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, as people finish the video training assignments, they received recognition through &#8220;IQ&#8221; points. As they were accumulated, certain thresholds could be obtained, where the &#8220;IQ&#8221; points could be redeemed for gift cards and company rewards.</p>\n<h3>Motivating Compliance</h3>\n<p>With compliance, game mechanics is applied to insure guidelines for proper document and records management are learned and being followed. For employees, compliance training is uninspiring to say the least. They aren&#8217;t attracted to it, but they have to finish the different modules, and just want to get it done.</p>\n<p>In this case Badgeville designers realized that a system of points and badges wouldn&#8217;t offer much incentive to complete the requirements. Instead, a system of achievement cards were developed where each user could see their progress with each module. Knowing where the &#8220;light at the end of the tunnel&#8221; was, helped to motivate them to finish each module. So, instead of making it seem like an arduous chore, the system focused on the progress and what has to be done.</p>\n<p>The use of a mission game mechanic can be adopted to set a guided path for each employ. In this instance the path is laid out in a prescribed manner, listing the sequence of things that must be done in order to finish. (With compliance, most employees are not really interested in discovery.) This helps to insure that each employee covers every required element and that the compliance obligation is fulfilled. This example illustrates the advantages of having a prescribed mission plan.</p>\n<h3>A Final Survey</h3>\n<p>Chris launched a final short survey of the listeners to poll them on what aspect of SharePoint would they first consider for gamification. Not surprisingly, collaboration (41.3%) and learning (22.1%) were the leaders. Expertise or reputation (13.4%) and content management (13.4%) followed, with compliance (5.8%) last among the specific aspects listed. (Some listeners also indicated that they had no plans for gamification (2.3%) or unspecified plans (1.7%).)</p>\n<p>Some Badgeville Results and Conclusions</p>\n<p>Chris and Caroline concluded the webinar with a summary of findings from the Badgeville client-base of &#8220;World-Class Companies&#8221; that have used gamification. They mention a wide range of company types that were represented &#8211; from technology and media companies to a large oil company. In general some notable improvements have resulted from gamification.</p>\n<p><strong>Contributions</strong><br />\nDocs Created 21%<br />\nIdea Submission 36%</p>\n<p><strong>Expertise</strong><br />\nProfile Views 20%<br />\nQuestions Answered 47%<br />\nRatings and Votes 58%</p>\n<p><strong>Retention</strong><br />\nDaily Return 50%<br />\nWeekly Return 40%</p>\n<p>The level of contribution has increased dramatically, while uncovering and bringing out expertise has also become more compelling. Finally, gamification has been key in creating a more &#8220;sticky&#8221; user experience, where people come back more frequently.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion on Badgeville Gamification for Microsoft Sharepoint</h3>\n<p>It should be noted that implementing and maintaining a gamified system is only the first step in building an effective system for improving collaboration. Corporate gamification is an ongoing endeavor and subject to continuous improvement. By iterating and modifying over time, employee engagement and collaboration can be sustained.</p>\n<p>Badgeville has demonstrated that applying game mechanics in corporate environments can enhance employee engagement, encourage productive behavior and ultimately improve company performance in a number of ways. But for it to be effective, the implementation must be carefully thought out and take advantage of what can be gleaned from the user experiences within the company.</p>\n<p>In the case of SharePoint, gamification can be used to address the disappointing trend of platform adoption. With Badgeville for Sharepoint, the smart application of game mechanics will enable companies to influence and reward key user behavior and ultimately improve collaboration. With increased employee involvement and collaboration, all areas of company operations are subject to potential benefit.</p>\n<p>(Thanks to Jerry Fuqua for tremendously helping me on this post!)</p>\n",

As a child you may have read a Dr. Seuss book called <em>I Can Read With My Eyes Shut</em> where you were told, \u201cThe more you learn, the more you read, the more things you will know. The more you learn, the more places you\u2019ll go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Although we are supposed to regard learning as a joy, it often doesn\u2019t feel that way. There is a lot of information that we need to digest and remember because we are required to do so for school or work.</p>\n<p>However, these seemingly uphill challenges can be overcome with learning games. Essentially, these are games that have been designed to optimize the acquisition of information or skills.</p>\n<p>With such tools, it is possible to achieve high levels of mastery without the normal feelings of resistance and uphill struggle that we often face in classroom settings and assigned course work.</p>\n<p>Another perspective on the question of what are learning games \u00a0is that they demonstrate new ways of understanding our own innate aptitudes and how we best learn.</p>\n<h3><b>New Perspectives On Intelligence</b></h3>\n<p>Researchers are redefining what it means to be smart and how our brains are wired to learn.</p>\n<h4>The Theory of Multiple Intelligences</h4>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/l2QtSbP4FRg\" height=\"315\" width=\"420\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The Theory of Multiple Intelligences was developed in 1983 \u00a0by a psychologist and professor of neuroscience at Harvard University named Howard Gardner.</p>\n<p>Whereas most schools emphasize linguistic and mathematical/logical aptitudes, his framework regards intelligence as being multifaceted to include other areas of proficiencies such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>musical intelligence &#8211; ability to create new music due to a sensitivity to sound, pitch, rhythm and tones</li>\n<li>visual spatial intelligence &#8211; ability to visualize and use spatial judgment</li>\n<li>kinesthetic (bodily) intelligence- ability to control movement and train responses through a sense of timing and goals</li>\n<li>intrapersonal intelligence &#8211; ability to introspect to understand ones own emotions, states of being, sense of self in order to create new reactions to external circumstances</li>\n<li>interpersonal intelligence &#8211; ability to relate to others and create harmonious relationships, often within a cooperative group context</li>\n<li>naturalistic intelligence &#8211; ability to relate and communicate information naturally within one\u2019s own surroundings</li>\n<li>existential intelligence &#8211; ability to understand a deeper metaphysical or spiritual level of existence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These abilities are often exhibited by exceptional individuals whose talents often lie beyond the skills that are esteemed by formal education.</p>\n<p>However, it should be noted that most people carry all of these proficiencies to some degree. They must be given opportunities to develop them further.</p>\n<h4>Multisensory Learning</h4>\n<p>Researchers are also acknowledging the concept of multisensory learning. We are naturally predisposed to taking in information through multiple forms of sensory input. Life presents us with different types of stimuli such as sight, sound, touch, taste and smell. And we are designed to filter what is relevant and make decisions on this input to best navigate our world.</p>\n<p>Information that fits our preferred learning modalities is more \u00a0likely to be understood, remembered and even utilized to a greater extent compared to knowledge that is communicated through just sight (e.g. textbook material) or sound (e.g. regular lecture).</p>\n<h3><b>Games and The New Paradigms of Learning and Intelligence</b></h3>\n<p>Here are some new perspectives for those who are just starting to ask, what are learning games and are they really beneficial?</p>\n<p>Learning games can be digital or non digital. They allow individuals to interact with information, instead of passively absorbing it. \u00a0They engage multiple senses at the same time often through a combination of sight, sound and touch. And this aligns with how we naturally like to learn.</p>\n<p>Players are typically encouraged to employ more than one type of intelligence to achieve the objectives of the game.</p>\n<p>Well designed learning games motivate persistence. And they help optimize the way we take in new information by using mechanisms that relate to our core drives. Again, the Octalysis model lists these as:</p>\n<p>1. Epic meaning and calling</p>\n<p>2. Accomplishment</p>\n<p>3. Empowerment</p>\n<p>4. Social pressure</p>\n<p>5. Unpredictability</p>\n<p>6. Scarcity</p>\n<p>7. Avoidance</p>\n<p>8. Ownership</p>\n<h3><b><!--more-->What Are Learning Games For?</b></h3>\n<p>Learning games can be played by anyone. But they can make life much easier for those who need to fulfill specific subject requirements. This would include course objectives for:</p>\n<p>1) Kids and young adults in school</p>\n<p>2) Employees who are trying to get through training material</p>\n<h4>Learning Games For Kids</h4>\n<p>For children, there are games for developing mastery in areas such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>phonics</li>\n<li>reading comprehension</li>\n<li>languages</li>\n<li>arithmetic</li>\n<li>algebra</li>\n<li>personal money management</li>\n<li>computer programming</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept of gamified schools is now on the rise. For example, Game Desk is an organization that is devoted to changing the way students learn. They have created a \u201cnext generation\u201d educational model that embraces the use of games.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CCp_9304j3Q\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Playmaker was developed by Game Desk \u00a0as new school model that is based on playing, making, discovery and inquiry and a curriculum driven by the individual interests of students. These initiatives are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Other sponsors include: AT&amp;T, USC and the National Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>Quest 2 Learn is an actual school that incorporates games in its curriculum to include systems of quests, boss levels and other familiar aspects of gamification.</p>\n<h4><b>Learning Games For Adults\u00a0</b></h4>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/OA3HxvYPzbU\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Talent development specialists at enterprise level companies are now becoming interested in using games to expedite training and the mastery of new information and skills. \u00a0Examples of areas that might benefit from these types of programs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>customer relations</li>\n<li>sales</li>\n<li>negotiations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A study was conducted by the University of Colorado Denver Business School to learn about the effects of video games on employee learning. This research was conducted by Traci Sitzmann, an assistant professor of management.</p>\n<p>The study examined 65 cases and data of learning performance from 6476 trainees. The effect of using video games was compared to other forms of informational presentation. Video games showed to be a superior learning tool according to the following dimensions of mastery:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>11% higher in factual knowledge</li>\n<li>14% higher in the performance of skills</li>\n<li>9% higher in retention</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Is It Possible To Become Overly Reliant On Learning Games?</b></p>\n<p>The answer to the question of <em>what are learning games for</em> may elicit some criticism.</p>\n<p>Some feel that using gamification for learning purposes is unnecessary and excessive. \u00a0Their perspective is that learning is not always going to be fun. Therefore individuals should not constantly depend on the availability of games.</p>\n<p>My response to this is that the purpose of using games for learning is to help communicate information in a more meaningful way.</p>\n<p>Class lectures and textbook assignments are limited in how well they can convey deeper levels of information. Students often rely on rote memorization to get through their courses. And this information is quickly forgotten.</p>\n<p>Games are simply additional tools to offer an additional dimension to the process of understanding and remembering information.</p>\n<p>Learning games illustrate that information can be experienced differently depending on how it is presented. And students can use this takeaway to leverage their personal creativity to be proactive and create their own sense of relevancy, meaning and beauty in every learning opportunity.</p>\n<p><em>(Thanks to\u00a0Christine Yee for tremendously helping me on this post)</em></p>\n",

Anyone out there who would like to write about similar topics, feel free to reach out to me.)</em></p>\n<p>I started playing <a title=\"Grepolis\" href=\"http://us.grepolis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grepolis</a> about one and a half months ago, when I discovered the game in the Google Chrome store. This game is set in Greek times, and the military units, vessels, buildings, and gods are all shaped around Greek culture. Grepolis is a game where the player joins an alliance, builds up his city, and conquers others. According to InnoGames, the company that owns Grepolis and several other games, there are over 16 million registered players. This game is very engaging and many Octalysis principles are applied to it.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/j_DWmvacFWY\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<h3>Core Drive #1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling in Grepolis</h3>\n<p>Grepolis is a game where you are the leader of a city, and you try to build up that city and conquer the cities of others. Being the ruler of multiple cities across the ocean makes you feel more powerful than how you feel in real life. You need to help defend your allies when they are attacked and participate in operations where everyone lands their attacks on their assigned cities at the same time. The objective of the game is to build the World Wonders and bring glory to your alliance. This is a purpose that is bigger than oneself, hence engaging.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #2: Development &amp; Accomplishment in Grepolis</h3>\n<p>In the game, there are some tutorial quests that give you rewards as you complete them. There are also achievements such as &#8220;Attacker of the day&#8221; or &#8220;Defender of the day.&#8221; There is also a sense of accomplishment when you climb up the rankings. Finally, after the world you are playing on goes on for a while, there is a final stage where all the alliances race to build the world wonders, and the first alliance to complete 4 of the 7 wonders wins the world.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback in Grepolis</h3>\n<p>You cannot really design how your city is built, but you can decide which buildings you consider valuable to upgrade and which to not (there is a maximum amount of farm space that you can have once you upgrade your farm to the max, and if you build all your buildings to the top level, you would have less room for troops) . There is an academy where research is done, but if you upgrade the academy to the max, you still are not able to research all the available technologies. You need to choose which researches should be researched for that specific city and your style of play. Meaningful choices lead to more engagement.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #4: Ownership &amp; Possession in Grepolis</h3>\n<p>In Grepolis, there exists the desire to capture more cities and expand your empire. Also, you and your alliance desire to build world wonders and win the war. This can result in players staying up really late to time their attacks perfectly, attempting to attack with the most efficient way.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h3>Core Drive #5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness in Grepolis</h3>\n<p>This drive is present in Grepolis, as you can develop lasting friendships with other players. This can make it really difficult to quit the game because that would mean having to end your relationship with someone else who you may have been working with for a few years. On a smaller scale, if you don\u2019t log in at the right time, your teammates might become upset at you, giving you a very strong motivation to log in at different hours (sometimes secretly).</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience in Grepolis</h3>\n<p>Impatience is a very prominent idea in Grepolis, since basically everything you do takes time, from upgrading buildings to sending attacks to demanding resources. There is not much you can do for a large amount of time (and there is no chat system). That is why you can use gold, the premium currency, to speed up the development of your empire, though even with gold you still cannot play for that long since you have a limited amount of resources (you cannot buy resources, but you can speed up resource production). By limiting what a player can do at each time, players are constantly thinking about the game because they need to come back when the right time is there.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #7: Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity in Grepolis</h3>\n<p>The battle system in Grepolis has a major factor in it called luck. Bad luck can change the result of a battle from a glorious victory to a disappointing defeat. Even if you have spied your enemy&#8217;s cities and entered your troops into the simulator and have came to the conclusion that you have sure victory, it can also happen that the enemy has seen your attack and that their allies have come to their aid. That makes the player very anxious to know what the result of the battle is.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #8: Loss and Avoidance in Grepolis</h3>\n<p>As in all things that someone spends time and effort in, quitting would involve accepting the fact that you have wasted all the hours that you have spent playing the game. Spending large amounts of time (months) away from the game would probably result in you being kicked from your alliance and finding that all your cities have been captured by others. This is a great example of the Sunk-Cost Tragedy, which is Game Technique #50.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion for Game Mechanics for the Game Grepolis</h3>\n<p>As you can see, this game applies to all 8 Core Drives in Octalysis, some more than others. To make the game better, InnoGames can improve the Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback Core Drive (#3). Grepolis can become even more engaging if the game allows you to chose which buildings to build, and if you can also customize your own units. That way there would more meaningful choices a player can make and demonstrate their own styles.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YOwK7Q5Ti4A\" height=\"315\" width=\"420\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n",

Currently, it still remains one of the Top 10 Games on Facebook.</p>\n<p>The interesting thing is, FarmVille really <a title=\"Farmville isn't that fun\" href=\"http://socialtimes.com/farmville-is-more-of-a-social-obligation-than-a-social-game_b11196\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">isn&#8217;t that &#8220;fun</a>.&#8221; It just mastered some very strong game mechanics to <a href=\"http://ninakix.posterous.com/why-is-farmville-so-addicting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get everyone addicted to it</a>, and then have them <a title=\"Farmville Fun\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/social.media/09/28/farmville.popularity/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">invite their friends to play with them</a>.</p>\n<p>When you ask FarmVille players whether the game is &#8220;fun&#8221; or not, you never hear people say, &#8220;Its SO amazing!&#8221; What you actually will hear is, &#8220;it&#8217;s okay&#8230; I play it every day so I guess it&#8217;s pretty fun. You should try it, and make sure you become my neighbor and give me these special crops!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Similar to my post that analyzes <a title=\"How Diablo III uses Game Mechanics to become Winning &amp; Addicting\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-research/diablo-iii-gamification-winning-addicting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the game mechanics of Diablo 3</a>, this post analyzes the game mechanics that FarmVille uses to become Winning &amp; Addicting.</p>\n<h2>Basic Game Mechanics</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Virtual Reality and Fantasy</h3>\n<p>Like all sim related games, FarmVille allows the player to imagine herself living the life of someone else, in this case the exciting life of a &#8211; woopdidoo &#8211; Farmer!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even though there are some applications in this within Gamification, it mostly ties into the concept of Serious Games, so we won&#8217;t be learning too much from this here.</p>\n<h3>Virtual Currency, Goods, and Values</h3>\n<p>This first thing a game needs to do, is to get the users to care about <em>something</em>. Sometimes it&#8217;s overcoming challenges, sometimes it&#8217;s finding out more about the storyline, and in Farmville&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s caring about virtual goods and properties.</p>\n<p>FarmVille players are quickly introduced to a FarmVille currency system called Farm Coins, and as they invest more and more time to accumulate Farm Coins, it establishes value in the players head.</p>\n<p>More importantly, because players are trying to build the best farm possible, there now is a new value system based on various crops and properties. Points (coins) aren&#8217;t just there for kicks and giggles, but there is actually an ecosystem where they could convert into other things that the player has learned to covet but are difficult to obtain.</p>\n<p>Most of the other game mechanics can only work because of this value that is installed into the mind of players.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/God-Farmville-Gamification.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2237\" style=\"border: 2px solid black;\" title=\"God Farmville Gamification\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/God-Farmville-Gamification.jpg?resize=450%2C244&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"God Farmville Gamification\" width=\"450\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/God-Farmville-Gamification.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/God-Farmville-Gamification.jpg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Ownership and Possession</h3>\n<p><!--more-->With a new base of value established, FarmVille then gets the player glued onto the idea of ownership and the insatiable need to possess more.</p>\n<p>You now have a farm, and its your responsibility to take care of it and grow it. No one&#8217;s going to force you to grow it, but if you don&#8217;t, you would have owned something very lousy. You would grow it by possessing more things on your property, which will then require more responsibility to maintain.</p>\n<p>The concept of ownership is very important in the work place and education as well. If you are constantly forcing employees or students to do something, they will lack motivation and only do the bare minimum of what you will accept (which sometimes end up being good enough). But if you give them ownership of what they do, they often go above and beyond their responsibilities.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been well <a title=\"Employee Motiviation\" href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/employee-empowerment-common-cornerstone-organizational-development-change-programs-727.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studied</a> that employees who are empowered and told &#8220;this is your project now. Do whatever you want with it but you will be remembered by what comes out at the end&#8221; will perform much higher than those who are just told what to do.</p>\n<h3>Progress and Development</h3>\n<p>Everyone needs to feel that they are growing and getting somewhere. In FarmVille, even though every single day players are engaged in the same monotonous tasks of clicking endlessly on their crops, they feel a sense of progress as their Farm Coins go up, and more importantly, when they can spend their hard-earned Farm Coins to expand their land or buy an expensive mansion.</p>\n<p>This is the reason why a kid would wake up 3AM behind their parents&#8217; back, just to kill the same monsters again and again in order to level up &#8211; even though the task itself is considered grunt work by definitions, seeing a sense of progress and a keen site to the end-goal (being strong enough to beat a boss) is enough to get them motivated.</p>\n<p>A feel for progress and development is essential for any product or project. Similar to the saying, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t measure it, you can&#8217;t improve it,&#8221; in Gamification, <strong>If you can&#8217;t keep score, you can&#8217;t motivate</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Game Mechanics</h2>\n<h3>Scarcity and Impatience</h3>\n<p>Scarcity (both in time and resources) is a given in life &#8211; you can&#8217;t have everything you want &#8211; and <strong>when that scarcity is controlled by a master game designer, it can turn a a crowd of intelligent people into an anthill of mindless drones.</strong></p>\n<p>Once a set of values and sense of ownership is established, Farmville uses many &#8220;<a title=\"Time based limitations\" href=\"http://landor.com/#!/talk/articles-publications/articles/gamification-brands-put-their-game-face-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Time-Based Limitations</a>&#8221; to create Scarcity as well as impatience.</p>\n<p>When the player plants a crop, he needs to wait a few hours to a few days before he can reap the goods. The required waiting, or so-called <a title=\"Appointment dynamics\" href=\"http://stratsynergy.wordpress.com/game-mechanics/g-l/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appointment dynamics</a>\u00a0creates eagerness and impatience from the player. And as a result, the player feels anxious to check up on his crops regularly and see if the waiting period is over or not, even if he intellectually understands that the appointed time has not passed yet.</p>\n<p>On a bigger scale, Farmville will dangle something even more grand, perhaps a larger farm, or a big mansion, which will require another 100 hours of gameplay to obtain. Players stare at those amazing virtual pixels, and they need to have it. The problem is that they can&#8217;t have it now! This sets the path to the grinding that they will do for the next 3 weeks, because there&#8217;s no other way to get what they want immediately.</p>\n<p>Oh actually, there are other ways. Users can simply invite their friends to give them stuff, or spend $5 real money to get what they want immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WOW! I can just spend $5 and save myself 100 hours of playing Farmville! That&#8217;s a no-brainer!!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a user is no longer spending $5 for a silly picture of a house on his screen. He is spending money to save the time and work required to get that silly picture of a house. And of course, his time is much more valuable than the silly house itself right?</p>\n<p><strong>So now we see the\u00a0bizarre\u00a0phenomenon of people playing games for free, and then paying real money in order to skip much of the required playing.</strong></p>\n<p>Scarcity and Impatience is a very powerful mechanic, and is one of the most dominating sources of monetization for social games these days, primarily because most social gamers are not very patie</p>\n<p>Imagine if you could harness the power of impatience to do good &#8211; where a person must do something that benefits society in order to get what he really really wants quickly. That would be something.</p>\n<h3>Companionship and Social Pressure</h3>\n<p>Social Pressure is another strong force that drive our actions (that&#8217;s why peer pressure is that powerful in our lives). Farmville skillfully manages Social Pressure by giving players bonuses whenever they invite friends to the game. Yea, every social game does that so thats not special. What&#8217;s special about what Farmville does is that it makes you &#8220;earn&#8221; by harassing your friends, much like <a title=\"Networking Marketing\" href=\"http://www.abcarticledirectory.com/Article/7-Habits-of-Highly-Annoying-Network-Marketers/1213010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Network Marketing</a>.</p>\n<p>In Farmville, there are regular crops and buildings you can obtain through massive amounts of time invested and Farm Coins. However, there are some items that you generally need to purchase with real money. MAN, I need to spend REAL money on this game?? Grr&#8230;.but oh wait! If I have some neighbors, they can give me the same thing for free!</p>\n<p>Now by asking your friends to join Farmville and be your friend, you effectively got something that was worth REAL money! What a deal! More importantly, Farmville&#8217;s mechanic is that it doesn&#8217;t cost your neighbor a dime to give these high-end items to you &#8211; its just created from thin air when they agree to give you something.</p>\n<p><strong>So basically, harassing friends to join Farmville and give you high-end stuff is a win-win situation! &lt;3</strong></p>\n<p>Just like how paying $5 in real money is an amazing deal to save 100 hours of work, forcing 2 friends to join is an amazing deal to save $5 off buying that awesome cow!</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s how the game becomes viral and\u00a0profitable\u00a0at the same time.</p>\n<p>This is a similar concept to what Andrew Warner, a friend of mine and the Founder of\u00a0<a title=\"Best Entrepreneur Education Resource\" href=\"http://mixergy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mixergy, the BEST entrepreneur education resource online</a>, coined as &#8220;<a title=\"Must Marketing\" href=\"http://mixergy.com/how-must-marketing-helped-me-bootstrap-a-profitable-startup-andrew-warner-interview-by-lisa-bruckner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Must Marketing</a>&#8221; &#8211; in order to play, you MUST invite your friends. Farmville adapts a &#8220;freemium&#8221; model where users can play for free, but to access premium content, they must invite their friends (or pay money). Perhaps this is called &#8220;Must Marketing Freemium.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Loss and Avoidance</h3>\n<p>Studies have shown most people would do more to prevent a loss than to obtain a gain.</p>\n<p>In FarmVille, if you happen to collect your crops a few hours late, your crops would die with ugly, uninspiring graphics. That means all the mindless clicking you did 10 hours ago were completely wasted!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-Farmville-Dead-Crops.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2224\" style=\"border: 2px solid black;\" title=\"Gamification Farmville Dead Crops\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-Farmville-Dead-Crops.png?resize=274%2C275&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gamification Farmville Dead Crops\" width=\"274\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-Farmville-Dead-Crops.png?w=274&amp;ssl=1 274w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-Farmville-Dead-Crops.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>To avoid the death of crops, users are required to go back to Farmville every single day (or every few hours, depending on how impatient they are) to prevent the world-ending disaster of seeing dead crops on their farms.</p>\n<p>Its mechanics like these that make my mom, who barely even checks her email, wake up at 5AM in the morning just to reap some of the crops that she has sown the evening prior. And I thought gamers were supposed to be an escapism away from daily responsibilities. <strong>When did gaming become another set of obligations that could be even more demanding than real life?</strong></p>\n<p>More importantly, with far higher implications, players fall into a large scale\u00a0psychological\u00a0spiral called the <a title=\"Sunk Cost Fallacy of Farmville\" href=\"http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sunk Cost Fallacy</a>. I&#8217;ve had many friends who\u00a0acknowledges\u00a0to themselves that Farmville is truly a waste of time in their lives, and <a title=\"Quit Farmville\" href=\"http://andreavahl.com/facebook/how-to-stop-playing-farmville.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they really want to quit</a>.</p>\n<p>However, if they quit, then the hundreds of hours they spent on Farmville will TRULY be wasted. <strong>So players keep playing to &#8220;avoid feeling the pain of loss and the ugly sensation waste creates.&#8221;</strong> And as they spend more time protecting themselves from feeling the loss, they invest even more time into the game, creating a bigger loss.</p>\n<p>Hmm, how depressing.</p>\n<p>I remember when <a title=\"Lifestyle Gamification: How to Convert your Life into a Game\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/lifestyle-gamification/lifestyle-gamification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I quit Diablo 2 many years ago</a>, I too felt the resistance to avoid the pain of loss. The way I could finally get out of that trap was to think BIG enough. I thought &#8220;Okay&#8230;.20 years from now, I wouldn&#8217;t be playing Diablo 2 &#8211; if I did, I would be a sad sad fool. So if I&#8217;m not going to be playing 20 years from now, why play 5 years from now? If not 5 years from now, why a year from now? Why today?&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Thinking about the future is the medicine to cure you from attachment to the past.</strong></p>\n<p>There are many employees who work at their companies and completely hate their jobs (if you are the employer, consider using Gamification to make the workplace more fun, but more importantly, show CARE and APPRECIATION to your employees!) However, many of these employees stay at their jobs because they don&#8217;t want to waste the time they waited for their stock options, the work they accumulated in their projects, or the &#8220;almost getting a raise!&#8230;maybe&#8230;&#8221; period.</p>\n<p>While Loss and Avoidance is not a very honorable way to keep employees and customers engaged, it is one of the most powerful gaming mechanics, so if you do happen to utilize this technique, make sure you attach it to positive activities that would be a win-win situation for all (for instance, have people accumulate their work in an amazing and impactful project, within an working environment that cares about them!)</p>\n<p>With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.</p>\n<h3>Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Farmville-Gamification-Mario.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2227\" style=\"border: 2px solid black;\" title=\"Farmville Gamification Mario\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Farmville-Gamification-Mario.jpg?resize=320%2C320&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Farmville Gamification Mario\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Farmville-Gamification-Mario.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Farmville-Gamification-Mario.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Farmville-Gamification-Mario.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>At this point, it&#8217;s pretty apparent that my position towards Farmville is not a favorable one, as I believe most of the time it is a mind-numbing machine that simply brilliantly utilizes all the right game mechanics (and my goal is to help people learn these mechanics and do good with it!). However, there is one element of Farmville that I think is positive and addicting for the right reasons &#8211; it allows everyone to creatively express themselves.</p>\n<p>Have you ever played Lego when you were little? Who would ever say that playing Lego is a bad thing? (unless it makes you <a title=\"Farmville Addiction\" href=\"http://mashable.com/2010/03/30/farmville-addiction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lose your job</a> or <a title=\"Murders baby\" href=\"http://mashable.com/2010/10/28/farmville-murder-mother-baby/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kill your child</a>) It allows you to expand your mind and turn that spark of genius into reality through little building blocks.</p>\n<p>In the same way, when Farmville players plays the game for long enough, some of them become Farmville Artists to express their creativity and create amazingly beautiful pieces of art through the digital pixels of Farmville (using Paint might still be more efficient, but Hey!

Released in November of 2004, World of Warcraft holds the Guinness Record for most subscribers of any MMORPG.</p>\n<p>World of Warcraft\u2019s popularity has seeped into popular culture in many forms, and has been known to be addicting. Some players report losing months, and even years, of their lives planted in front of their computers while questing and leveling their characters. World of Warcraft\u2019s popularity and addicting nature can be traced to the <a href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/what-is-gamification/\">game mechanics</a>\u00a0design implemented by Blizzard.</p>\n<p>Gamification is design that places the most emphasis on the human in the process. It&#8217;s Human-Focused Design, as opposed to \u201cfunction-focused design\u201d. The gamification framework Octalysis, makes it very easy to see how World at Warcraft can be so addicting.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</h3>\n<p>Epic meaning and calling refers to the drive players feel when they believe what they are doing is greater than themselves. Whether it is helping fellow players, or contributing to a wiki, players often feel that the good of the community rests on their shoulders.</p>\n<p>World of Warcraft relies on epic meaning and calling from the beginning of character creation, and throughout the game as players become more involved. First, players must choose between opposing factions, the Alliance and the Horde. Additionally, players may also join guilds or groups. Much of World of Warcraft\u2019s gameplay is designed so that players can only complete certain quests as a member of a group. Because players must rely on one another, every individual must understands that his role in the game also supports the greater good of the group.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #2: Development &amp; Accomplishment</h3>\n<p>This refers to overcoming challenges, making progress, and developing skills. The challenge aspect of this portion of the framework is essential for players to find meaning in their activity.</p>\n<p>Development and accomplishment are probably the most prolific aspects of gamification within World of Warcraft. The majority of players who experienced <a title=\"addicted to playing WoW\" href=\"http://www.kensavage.com/archives/another-kid-dies-from-playing-online-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WoW addiction</a> to the game report the overwhelming need for their characters to level up, gain new skills, or become more powerful. Completing quests allows players this opportunity, and is one of the driving focuses of the game.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback</h3>\n<p><!--more-->This is when users come to a decision where they must decide how they are going to build their character and how that character is going to battle against their enemies. Most of this planning happens in real-time due to constant changes in PvP.</p>\n<p>Another important part in creating their characters is giving them ways to express their creativity. They need to be able to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and respond in turn.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #4: Ownership &amp; Possession</h3>\n<p>This is the drive to \u201cwant\u201d something, or protect and improve what they feel like they have ownership over. This aspect of the Octalysis is the main factor that drives players to obtain virtual goods and play collection games. Weapons and gold in World of Warcraft provide the sense of ownership to the player.</p>\n<p>Ownership &amp; Possession in World of Warcraft also come in the form of more powerful weapons and skills from completing quests and destroying enemies. As players progress, they gain new talents. Those skills must be further refined to make the character more powerful. Players may feel the need to complete a match to acquire a new weapon, or level up to gain a new skill. This is one of the main factors that players report keeping them from walking away from a session long after they had planned on stopping.</p>\n<p>Many World of Warcraft addicts describe the feeling of pride they find in the grind of obtaining gold and new weapons. Similarly, players find a sense of ownership in their character, and its avatar. When asked for reasons on why they felt they spent so much time playing World of Warcraft, most addicts responded that the need to accumulate the best gear and collect more gold was the most important aspect of the game.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #5: Social Influence &amp; Relatedness</h3>\n<p>This drive refers to the need for companionship, acceptance, and belonging. Players seek to find shared experiences with their peers, and strive to elevate themselves in front of others.</p>\n<p>There is a large social element to World of Warcraft. Many quests are designed in a way that players must cooperate with others in order to complete challenges and defeat more powerful enemies. Additionally, players who are active guild members reported they were more likely to play at inconvenient hours if friends and members of their guild were playing.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #6: \u00a0Scarcity &amp; Impatience</h3>\n<p>This drive revolves around the player wanting what they cannot have. This drive can become even stronger if players are forced to wait for their rewards.</p>\n<p>In World of Warcraft, scarcity and impatience are linked by multiple aspects within the game\u2019s design. The catalyst of scarcity is the need for gold, equipment, and time. Gold and equipment are received for the completion of quests and challenges. Players want to master their skills, they want to perfect hteir gear, and they want to beat the hardest bosses, but they just can&#8217;t &#8211; yet. This sense of scarcity, limitation and impatience drives a lot of activity within World of Warcraft.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #7: Curiosity &amp; Unpredictability</h3>\n<p>This drive compels players to find out what might happen next. Whether the expected result is positive or negative, the element of chance spurs players on.</p>\n<p>Many aspects are built around unpredictability in World of Warcraft. Random equipment and gold amounts are dropped by defeating enemies; NPCs may offer mini-quests, or open player vs. player requests may come at random. Those players that preferred the player vs. player aspects of the game were more likely to challenge a more powerful player, in the hope of an unlikely win.</p>\n<h3>Core Drive #8: Loss &amp; Avoidance</h3>\n<p>This drive centers on the need to avoid a negative effect from an action or loss of action. This could also mean avoiding hard truths that a player\u2019s time has been meaningless.</p>\n<p>Some recovering World of Warcraft addicts have admitted that before they stopped, they realized they had spent too much of their life playing the game. Their reasoning for continuing to play after they knew they had a problem was the feeling that if they quit, their loss of time, jobs, relationships would have been for nothing.</p>\n<h3>World of Warcraft Game Mechanics are powerful.</h3>\n<p>As you can see, World of Warcraft utilizes a good proportion of all 8 Core Drives in Octalysis, which is why it does so well in getting over 10 million players actively paying and playing it. It is clearly a game of WoW.</p>\n",

You will not gain in intellectual capability by reading this post, so please decide if you think this would be worth your time. But after all, the name of this site is YukaiChou.com, so I think this post would still be appropriate, regardless of how egotistical it may seem)</p>\n<h3>I almost had a heart attack</h3>\n<p>So I was greedy.</p>\n<p>Every once in a while I get invited to go do some workshops, panels, or keynotes that require extensive traveling. Even though some are not the best paid and have extremely high opportunity costs (working with my clients, or just family time), my personal agenda is to make sure the world does gamfication properly instead of just slapping on PBLs on everything, so I tend to say yes when I can as long as the organization&#8217;s offer seems fair and sincere.</p>\n<h3>The Opportunity</h3>\n<p>In mid-April I was invited to two separate Keynote opportunities, one in Atlanta, Georgia and the other in\u00a0Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>\n<p>The one in Atlanta was a private conference for a couple dozen Chief Learning Officers of Fortune 500s gathering up to learn about the latest trends in employee training and compliance within the enterprise space (by the way, I feel that the employees of these particular companies should feel especially fortunate because these companies truly care about the growth of employees&#8230;to the point they have C-Level Officers dedicated to that).</p>\n<p>The one in Denmark was co-hosted by the Denmark Innovation Center (funded by the Denmark government) and Innovation Labs, a great knowledge technology center in Denmark. They have a conference on Gamification that attracted close to 100 of the most forward-thinking executives, entrepreneurs, and professionals in Denmark &#8211; awesome people in an awesome country.</p>\n<h3>The Rude Awakening</h3>\n<p>Since I more often than not check my emails with my iPhone on the go, I didn&#8217;t get a chance to go through my calendar carefully (checking surrounding dates) before I told both events that I was interested and available (of course, we also had other conversations about potential topics, length, etc.) But when I later went back and checked my calendar, I was in for a shock.</p>\n<p>The Atlanta talk was the afternoon of June 19th, and the Denmark talk was first thing in the morning on June 20th.</p>\n<p>Oh crap. What did I get myself into.</p>\n<p>At that point, the wise (but faint) voice in my head said I should probably email the event organizer of one of the events and cancel my commitment in order to ensure that I don&#8217;t end up being a major disappointment to anyone. The greedy (and somehow more charismatic) voice in my head said, &#8220;But is there really no way to make this work out?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Before anything, I did email both event organizers and transparently shared that I was facing this\u00a0dilemma, that I &#8220;may&#8221; end up canceling if I couldn&#8217;t work out the details, just so that they would have some heads up.</p>\n<h3>The Poetic Monologue</h3>\n<p>I was thinking that perhaps one of them would help me solve this dilemma by responding, &#8220;No problem. We have a few other speakers that have confirmed their attendance and they could do the Keynote instead. Enjoy your other talk!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Very sly, Yu-kai. Delegating the moral decision on someone else&#8217;s time. I also like how those two words rhyme, and for that, maybe you should reward me with a dime on top of some lime. Alright, I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m done. <strong>I promise.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Thinking about this entire thing was making me anxious.\u00a0If I went for both, it would really be a hit-or-miss.\u00a0If I could pull this off, I would feel like a\u00a0hippopotamus &#8211; full of bliss. But if something went wrong with the airline service, I&#8217;d be seen as a complete conference menace. Of course, I&#8217;m not ready to take that type of diss, as\u00a0It would be worse than drinking cow piss.</em></p>\n<p><em>And even if I did pull it off, I would probably be delirious and people would think I had been remiss. Or perhaps I would be so awesome that people wouldn&#8217;t even notice&#8230;but that just sounds like a naive practice without a sound basis. And despite being consumed by this foolishness, I wasn&#8217;t necessarily thinking about this with\u00a0a bad premise. There&#8217;s so much potential in gamification that the world can harness, and all I really wanted is to show up and make it surface.</em></p>\n<p><em>So if it has to come to this, which one should I dismiss?</em></p>\n<p><em>With all the Fortune 500&#8217;s, going to Atlanta could really help my business. And because of my parents, I was just in Geneva last Christmas. But a chance to visit Europe is hardly something one should just miss, especially when I heard that the other keynote is Deterding, who besides being a respected pundit, is often a doubting Thomas when he sees things amiss.\u00a0I could also go and visit William Baeyens (you can kind of think of him as my apprentice), whom I believe is based in Paris.</em></p>\n<p><em>And yes, I know. I broke my <strong>promise.</strong></em></p>\n<p>It was just too much fun.</p>\n<h3><!--more-->The Commitment</h3>\n<p>So what was I talking about again? Oh yea, I was having a hard time deciding what I should do about the two potential events.</p>\n<p>So fortunately for me, both event organizers wrote back to me, and generously said they would very much like to make it all work out for me if possible.</p>\n<p>The Atlanta conference proposed that they could move my talk to first thing in the morning on June 19th, which was 8:30, while the Denmark conference offered to move my talk to later in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>With that, I saw a glimpse of hope.</p>\n<p>I started doing some research about potential flights, as well as how long did it take to travel from the airport to the conference location. Both seemed to be about 30 minutes according to Google Maps, which of course is never wrong in predicting traffic conditions.</p>\n<p>I found a ticket that might just work out.</p>\n<h3>The Plan</h3>\n<p>So at that point I confirmed for both events and bought my tickets.</p>\n<p>The plan is that, on June 19th, I would start my first talk in Atlanta at 8:30am, which should end in 10am. I would then take the taxi to the Atlanta airport immediately, arriving at 10:30am.</p>\n<p>I would then spend an hour going through airport security, catching a 11:50am flight just in time.</p>\n<p>With the time differences (losing 9 hours, or +9 to your watch), I would land in Denmark 10am on June 20th, with just enough time (and more!) to make my next keynote at 1pm.</p>\n<p>As the great Fred Kim once said, the plan was flawless.</p>\n<h3>The anticipation</h3>\n<p>So that&#8217;s when things made me pretty nervous. For the month of May and early June, I was regularly thinking about this issue.</p>\n<p>As you could see, my plan didn&#8217;t allow for many mishaps in the middle. Usually for international flights, they recommend you being there 2-3 hours before flight time. I had an hour, and usually boarding starts 50 minutes before the flight time &#8211; yikes!</p>\n<p>I also couldn&#8217;t predict a few things: whether I would be able to end my talk and leave exactly at 10am on the 19th, would I be able to catch a cab immediately after finishing, and whether there would be traffic or not to the airport. I also didn&#8217;t know whether there would be flight delays (which happens quite often) or not, but this is something that for once would work in my favor. However, if the flight was cancelled or delayed for too long, I would also miss my connection flight and miss my keynote time in Denmark.</p>\n<p>As you can see, my landing-to-speech timeline is so tight that if any of the 3 planes I would be on had material problems, I would miss my talk.</p>\n<h3>Doubts</h3>\n<p>I also thought about the fact that, if I missed my speech in Denmark, not only would it not make any sense for the Denmark organizer to write me a check for the speaker fees, but there would be no reason for them to reimburse my plane tickets either (which were lower than the speaker fees but still in the 4-digits nonetheless).</p>\n<p>Basically, if one little thing goes wrong with logistics, everyone gets screwed.</p>\n<p>I started to regret my commitments. Those of you who have done financial projections would know, financial projections shows you what happens if EVERYTHING goes &#8220;conservatively&#8221; right. But in reality, that almost never happens.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s even worse, was that I later found out that my talk in Atlanta was not really close to the hotel&#8230;well, it was 10 minutes away, but that was a lot of minutes for my circumstances. My talk was going to be in the UPS headquarters (an amazing place by the way), which didn&#8217;t have any taxis or airport shuttles lurking around the entrance.</p>\n<p>It almost seemed like, I was betting on the possibility that the airlines would likely have small delays. One random positive variable to set off all the other random negative variables. Just writing this out right now sends a chill up my spine.</p>\n<p>My friends didn&#8217;t help me feel more cuddly about the situation. When hearing my circumstances, they said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no chance man. Seriously. It&#8217;s not possible. You should cancel it.&#8221; &#8220;Dude, the Atlanta Airport is one of the busiest ones in the US. You don&#8217;t have enough time.&#8221; Of course, that was indeed new information to me after I had made the commitment.</p>\n<p>My knees were in too deep, so the only thing I could do was to optimize on a few things and hold on to my faith.</p>\n<h3>Desperate Attempts</h3>\n<p>The first thing I did, was to make sure I didn&#8217;t have to check in any bags. Since I&#8217;m going to Europe, I decided to stay around for longer and meetup with some family and clients in Berlin, Munich, Geneva, and London, totaling 2.5 weeks.</p>\n<p>For this 2.5 week trip, I could only bring a carry-on (I apologized to my parents for not being able to bring them the gifts they asked for&#8230;but I still prepared something!), which would probably decrease my airport logistics time by 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>The other obvious thing I did, was to plan for checking out of my hotel and taking my luggage straight to my talk, and see if I could organize a ride to the airport directly from the UPS building.</p>\n<p>It was still dangerous, but I at least felt like I had some control.</p>\n<h3>Atlanta</h3>\n<p>I landed in Atlanta on the evening of the 18th. There was a dinner with the group that night, so I planned to attend a couple hours after settling into my hotel.</p>\n<p>However, there was a thunderstorm that evening, and when I took the taxi, there was massive traffic. What was supposed to be a 30 minute ride became 90 minutes. Needless to say I was very stressed and anxious about what would happen the next day. I&#8217;ve heard that this entire week would be occupied by thunderstorms, which would not only affect the traffic conditions, but also increase the chances of a cancelled flight.</p>\n<p>If going to the airport took just as much time as going from the airport, I would be a dead man. My heart was jumping out when I sat through the slow torture of stormy traffic.</p>\n<p>I started having conversations with my driver, and towards the end, I asked him to wait for me at the UPS building at 9:45 the next morning so that once I finish my speech, I can rush out and get on the ride.</p>\n<p>While at the dinner, I shared more about my hectic schedule, and everyone there was extremely supportive. They asked the organizer if we could even start earlier tomorrow, skipping the self-introductions and end the breakfast faster so I can start at 8AM and end earlier.</p>\n<p>That gave me better odds and I felt a lot better.</p>\n<h3>The Day in Question</h3>\n<p>The next morning I woke up at 6:30AM, which is actually 3:30AM for me since I was on Pacific Time.</p>\n<p>I did my speech, which was naturally on Octalysis, Gamification, and Human-Focused Design. It seemed to be very positive and I wished I had more time to not just talk about the basics of Octalysis but help them figure out how to implement it into their existing practices.</p>\n<p>Once I finished my speech, I immediately rushed out to the taxi that was waiting for me outside (apologizing to the attendees). I ended up forgetting my Macbook Pro Adapter, but the CLO of UPS told me that she knows a really good shipping company that could help me with that \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<p>I turned out to be EXTREMELY lucky. That day was a Wednesday, and according to Weather there would be thunderstorms on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, but not Wednesday!\u00a0The weather was nice, and traffic was\u00a0accommodating.</p>\n<p>My ride flowed like a river and I arrived at the airport at exactly 10:30AM. Since I didn&#8217;t need to check-in with my bag, I went through security quickly and got to my terminal at 11AM, 50 minutes before my flight!</p>\n<p>YES! I made it. At that point, I felt that a huge rock on my chest for weeks was finally lifted. I was so happy I did feel like a blissful\u00a0hippopotamus as I went onto the plane.</p>\n<h3>Copenhagan, Denmark</h3>\n<p>14 Hours later, after a transfer from DC, to the Frankfurt Airport in Germany (and hearing a joke from Gabe Zicherman about the Frankfurt Airport being in Ohio on Facebook), I finally landed in Denmark. However, since there was some flight delays, I still showed up an hour later than anticipated.</p>\n<p>At that point, I had to decide whether I wanted to go to my hotel and take a shower, or go straight to the conference.</p>\n<p>I tried to sleep on the airplane, but since it was afternoon time for my own timezone and the seats were uncomfortable, I had a hard time really resting, so I ended up watching 3.5 movies: Oz, the new Die Hard, Spiderman Tech (which was actually the most interesting), and the Hobbit.</p>\n<p>Remember I woke up at around 3:30AM in my own time zone? When I arrived at Copenhagan, it was about 2AM in my time zone. The worst thing about traveling is that, even though for the entire day you&#8217;re not doing much &#8211; just sitting on a plane and waiting at an airport &#8211; instead of feeling rested afterwards, you feel exhausted. Perhaps the true value of the first class seats is that they are &#8220;flights that refresh,&#8221; and is worth the thousands of dollars for people who needed high performance right after the flight (surgeons?)</p>\n<p>There was still a couple hours from my actual talk, and a shower + power nap would be quite amazing (and perhaps more responsible for the conference as I could perform better). However, I decided to go straight to the conference because I was interested in hearing Sebastian Deterding&#8217;s keynote so my talk does not overlap with the same information but builds on it.</p>\n<h3>The Discourse</h3>\n<p>After meeting some great people at the conference, it finally came time for my talk, which was 90 minutes. I made my &#8220;delirious disclosure&#8221; up front saying that I could pass out any moment. It&#8217;s been 24 hours since my sleep in Atlanta, with 14 of those on exhausting flights.</p>\n<p>The Danish are truly amazing folks. They were the most responsive (and knowledgable!) crowd I have spoken to on the topic of gamification. They were supportive throughout the entire time, gave great examples, related Octalysis to their own projects, and made me feel like home. They were also the only group of people I&#8217;ve seen that clapped in complete sync with each other &#8211; right on the beat.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Deterding was good sport. Since I know his reputation of being a critical academic (the doubting Thomas reference above), I was anticipating the entire time that he would jump in and start challenging my presentation. Towards the end of my talk, he did finally jump in and talked about how he disagreed with my definition of &#8220;social pressure&#8221; (Core Drive 5 for those who have been doing your homework) and went into a deeper talk about how the word &#8220;pressure&#8221; was incorrectly applied to some examples I gave. I simply responded that, in my definition, the &#8220;Social Pressure &amp; Envy&#8221; (now re-termed &#8220;Social Influence &amp; Relatedness) Core Drive just represents everything that relates to people changing their behavior <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">because</span> of what other people think.</p>\n<p>If what other people think is strong enough to make you change your behavior, that IS pressure. This is different from the common phrase peer pressure, where people actively push you in a direction. Social Pressure could just be about wanting to please someone, wanting to look good in front of others, or being kind to someone who was generous to you. Anyhow, I didn&#8217;t think his comments were unfounded, but from a usable standpoint, it is easier to design something by thinking through an inclusive theme of social pressure, and all the game techniques that push and motivation instead of wondering how technical the term is. Of course, if Sebastian or anyone has a better word that encompasses this inclusive drive, I&#8217;m very open to changing the terminology (but not a long technical term like &#8220;socially-driven motivation&#8221;)</p>\n<p>The funny thing is, in the dinner afterwards, I mentioned to Sebastian that I was anticipating him &#8220;correcting&#8221; my talk as I was giving it, and he responded with, &#8220;Well, it would be extremely rude of me if I interrupted you the entire time!&#8221; This made me smile as it sounded like he wanted to jump in throughout my talk but decided to stay polite until he couldn&#8217;t stand the blasphemy from me anymore.</p>\n<p>The nice thing is that, he gave me some saving grace and said (paraphrased), &#8220;I agree that from a usable standpoint, your framework is extremely useful in figuring out what to do in the design process. It&#8217;s just so academically incorrect!!&#8221; I think that&#8217;s a compliment I&#8217;ll keep and frame on my wall one day. (Maybe even a quote I can include on the cover of my next book!)</p>\n<h3>Finally an American</h3>\n<p>Through their generosity and enthusiasm, the Danish audience convinced me that I wasn&#8217;t that conference menace that would make Americans look bad (although a comment about the &#8220;Evil American&#8221;\u00a0stereotype\u00a0did come out when we were discussing the interesting topic of ethics in gamification &#8211; in a joking manner).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny how after years of being persecuted as the &#8220;Foreign Entrepreneur&#8221; from Taiwan (I was in a couple documentaries, including an interview done by PBS on why the US needs a Startup Visa), I actually get to represent Americans (while hitting continuous on-the-street references of my &#8220;American accent&#8221;). How the tides have turned.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the entire thing went extremely extremely successful, and I stuck around until the end of the conference, leading to a dinner that lasted till 11PM Denmark time, which of course was 2PM Pacific Time.</p>\n<p>And this concludes my exciting adventures of staying awake for 36 hours, delivering 2 speeches on 2 continents within 18 hours, and finally becoming an American while in Europe.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I&#8217;m thankful to God that everything went smoothly and so successfully. I also had a hell of a time.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed my story.</p>\n",

I read all of them and many of them are interesting but because of my 24/7 limited time and full agenda (between my clients, my video show, writing my own content, and writing my book, along with a few startup projects) I&#8217;m forced to dig deep only a few projects. ?Few days ago, I received an email from Marius Corici, CEO and Co-founder for the\u00a0<a title=\"Ctf365 Project\" href=\"http://ctf365.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CTF365 </a>startup project, asking me to take a look at what he&#8217;s working on it. That, really caught my attention and I started to do a little research.</p>\n<p>We live in a digital, connected world and security is one of the most important issues that today&#8217;s world confront with. According to Scientific American&#8217;s blog, last year there were 20 threats per second world wide which translates into over 1.7 millions threats per day. Don&#8217;t believe me? Google \u201chacked\u201d.</p>\n<h3>The Gamification Challenge</h3>\n<p>Security training is generally dull and boring, but essential.</p>\n<p>When it comes to learning information security, there are a few ways that people do. Through CS faculties (basics), security training companies (dull) or self taught \u2013 Google, forums, blogs (monotonous).</p>\n<p>However somebody has to do it because is essential.</p>\n<p>Frost &amp; Sullivan predicts global employment of information security professionals to increase by 332,000, ending 2013 at 3.2 million and reaching ~5 millions by 2017. These 5 million we talk are these that get a world wide recognized security certificate. Beside them there are around 25 millions users that regularly check into security, hacking and system administrator forums.</p>\n<h3>The Gamification Solution</h3>\n<p>What if we could have a method of security training that is not dull and boring &#8211; a method that would be fun, entertaining, challenging and community driven?</p>\n<p>We all know the best way to learn is to learn through applications, and that&#8217;s where gamification excels at with great results on education and training. Learning information security through gamification would increase students/employee engagement, improve retention rate and speed up the learning curve/process.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Top 10 Education Gamification Examples that will Change our Future\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/top-10-education-gamification-examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I recently wrote a post about the Top 10 Education Gamification Examples that Will Change Our Future.</a> Feel free to take a look.</p>\n<h3>CTF = Capture the Flag Gamification</h3>\n<p>Information Security through Gamification is not a brand new concept. In fact it&#8217;s been around for a while since the internet started. It is called CTF \u2013 Capture The Flag. The DefCon conference has one of the first CTF competitions and you can even check CTF Time to see where a CTF (within the information security industry) will take place. If you dig into CTFs, you&#8217;ll find CTFs organized by CS faculties, companies or even governments agencies.</p>\n<p>However there are a few problems thatmany CTF competitions have:</p>\n<p>\u2022 They Don&#8217;t last \u2013 Nowadays CTFs last between 24 hours up to 3 days only.<br />\n\u2022 Most have Geographical Limitations \u2013 Often times you have to be physically in that room/building.<br />\n\u2022 They are Scattered \u2013 it happens all over the world but they are scattered and short, which means almost all of them are small too.<br />\n\u2022 They Don&#8217;t Count \u2013 because of the problems described above, HR departments don&#8217;t concern themselves too much to high-achievers in these games.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why the team behind CTF365 decided that it is time to change the way Capture the Flag is designed and held by bringing a brand new approach to push security gamification into a bigger scale:</p>\n<h2>Game Design of CTF365</h2>\n<h3>Team-Based</h3>\n<p>The game is team-based which means it will improve and strengthen communication skills as teams are forced to work together under pressure developing critical attributes of any enterprise security team, especially for those like Red Teams, CERT, CSIRT etc.</p>\n<h3>Teams are from all around the world</h3>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">There are over 8500 registered users and more than 590 teams waiting for launch.</span></p>\n<p>Basically they&#8217;ve built an internet within The Internet. A place where security professionals, security students and security wannabes, system administrators and programmers can play and get continuous training over information security.</p>\n<h3>How does CTF365 work?</h3>\n<p>CTF365 is a real life game where \u201cPlayers\u201d build their own Fortress/VPS (virtual private server) and defend them while attacking other servers. It&#8217;s what happened in real life when your server or computer networks are under attack by hackers.</p>\n<p>Below are some questions I asked Marius:</p>\n<h3>Define CTF365 in one sentence.</h3>\n<p>\u201cWorld of Warcraft for Hackers.\u201d\u00a0As a \u201cPlayer\u201d, the awesome magic moves and fighting techniques will be represented by your ability to write crazy powerful scripts to hack.</p>\n<h3>How did CTF365 get your initial 8500 registered users before launch?</h3>\n<p>We do the usual strategies when your marketing budget is close to none:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Word of Mouth \u2013 Very powerful tool. This got us to hit the top on Hacker News and we got over 12,500 unique visits in one day and over 1000 registered users.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Referral campaigns \u2013 Bring 5,10, or 15 Players and get access to the Private Alpha, Private Beta, as well as premium accounts for testing.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Strategic partnerships \u2013 Free access for not-for-profit Information Security Conferences. This helped us to get featured on The Hacker News.</p>\n<h3>Why do you think CTF365 will catch your target Players&#8217; attention?</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not an expert in gamification but looking at your Octalysis Framework I can tell that at the beginning, CTF365 will have 4 Core Drives out of 8:</p>\n<p>Epic Meaning &amp; Calling \u2013 Learning, Training and Improving Security Skills. As a \u201cPlayer\u201d, playing CTF365 is like haven for everyone interested in information security starting from security professionals and security wannabe, all the way up to system administrators and developers. They can do and test things that are forbidden like attacking and hacking everyone else system without worries about legality.</p>\n<p>Ownership &amp; Possession \u2013 They can build their bases from scratch, own virtual goods (e.g. servers, routers, etc.), speedup learning curve and improving retention rate.</p>\n<p>Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback \u2013 Using different techniques they&#8217;ll be able to unlock certain milestone while having real-time control over their servers and receiving instant feedback.</p>\n<p>Accomplishment Core \u2013 Nothing would make them happy than being in \u201cHall of Fame\u201d leaderboard, wining prizes while collecting points and badges for their real skills.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s your ambition with CTF365 project</h3>\n<p>There are three goals that we want to achieve:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We want CTF365 to become a prerequisite for the InfoSec industry. A security professional certificate is important, but more important is what you really can do hands on.</li>\n<li>Become the World of Warcraft for the ITC industry. Using specific hacking tools is one thing, writing powerful scripts as a programmer is even cooler. Programmers can team up with ethical hackers to boost their teams.</li>\n<li>Linkedin on steroids for HR departments when hire security professionals.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Feel free to contact me if you would like to post a guest post here too.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>Gamification of Thrones</strong></h3>\n<p>Having had the wind knocked out of me from the heart-wrenching conclusion of Season 3 of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, I began to think of what else I could do in the meantime while I waited another eternity for my beloved show to come back.</p>\n<p>Given how much time I sit around thinking about two topics: Gamification and <i>Game of Thrones</i> (Game of Thrones), I found it fitting to unravel the show that has taken the world by storm and offer some semblance of an explanation as to why I and many others feel just as addicted to this show as any popular video game.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, this show has every addicting element beautifully woven together into an epic masterpiece that is able to appeal to anyone\u2026and here\u2019s why &#8211; from a screenwriting, gamification, and avid fan perspective.</p>\n<h3>Game of Thrones through the Lens of Gamification and Octalysis</h3>\n<p>To start with, this show naturally has plenty of violence and sex to appeal to our baser appetites and fulfill that Hollywood formula. This is of course the 9<sup>th</sup>, or \u201chidden\u201d Core Drive in the Gamification Framework Octalysis \u2013 Sensation.</p>\n<p>While this is a crucial element, it really is just a miniscule ingredient as the script and story itself stem from the creepy genius of George Martin who has already done the heavy lifting of crafting an elegant and fantastical world containing a gamut of interconnected characters vying for a claim to the throne.</p>\n<p>With the groundwork laid out, Game of Thrones is already ahead of its peers as it does not have to suffer from tight deadlines stifling the quality of creativity necessary for a story to unravel with the right amount of tension, unpredictability, character development, and the answer to those \u201cso what\u201d questions. (Remember how <i>Lost </i>unfolded?&#8230;me neither)</p>\n<p>While I can make the argument that Game of Thrones is well done from a screenwriting perspective, how exactly does this relate to gamification? Although we have typically thought of gamification as only relating to the addicting elements of games, Yu-kai Chou likes to refer to it as \u201cHuman-Focused Design,\u201d and can actually be thought of much more broadly given those same elements of great screenwriting touch upon the same core drives outlined in the Octalysis Framework.</p>\n<p>By providing an Octalysis Score of how Game of Thrones fares among each one of the Core Drives, it is my intent to exemplify how fundamental screenwriting principles increases an Octalysis score from a viewer and Game of Thrones character\u2019s perspective.</p>\n<p>(Warning..Spoiler Alert!)</p>\n<h3><b>Core Drive 7: Curiosity &amp; Unpredictability</b></h3>\n<p>With over 34 characters in the background of the world of Westeros \u2013 the fictional world where the action takes place \u2013 Game of Thrones has captivated audiences by featuring unpredictable plot twists that invoke a multitude of emotions.</p>\n<p>Just as one story ends, the genesis of a new plotline carries on concurrently to progress the story in a fashion where a constant tension always exists between what the audience believes to happen, what the characters intend to happen, and what actually happens.</p>\n<p>As main characters are killed off in realistic brutality usually reserved for the \u201cbad\u201d guy, viewers can\u2019t help but wonder and debate with their friends what will happen next. In an age where TV shows and movies are incredibly formulaic, and hence, predictable, watching a show where I have no idea what is going to happen until right before the moment is a welcomed surprise.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of welcomed surprises, the cunning and ambivalent Varys frequently demonstrates the core drive of Curiosity &amp; Unpredictability as he commands an army of \u201cbirdies\u201d across all lands to constantly keep him updated on gossip and critical war info. Having no real loyalty to any faction, Varys is an interesting conundrum who proves to be quite unpredictable himself as viewers have to wonder what ploy he will hatch next. Given how much this core drive jibes with both viewers and characters alike, I have to rate this as the strongest core drive for Game of Thrones, especially in the early Onboarding phases.</p>\n<h3><b>Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback</b></h3>\n<p><!--more-->Along the lines of wondering what is going to happen next, the core drive of creativity is extremely prevalent for both viewers and characters as each one of the major factions (Lannister, Stark, etc.) come up with all sorts of tactics and dirty ploys to usurp the throne.</p>\n<p>As we watch Rob Stark strategize in his war room while his mother, Catelyn Stark, negotiates with greedy and perverse lords, we can\u2019t help but creatively put ourselves in the shoes of the characters and scheme up various alliances and combinations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the short glimpses of an impending undead army marching down from the North as well as mythical dragons slowly growing up throughout the show serve to only add more fuel to the fire of imagination burning in each of our minds.</p>\n<p>Indeed, these thoughts can often be the fodder of stimulating conversations or daydreams from long commutes to work; however, it is perhaps Game of Thrones\u2019s ability to uniquely develop key characters in such a dynamic and deep way that there is a character that each one of us can closely identify with in our own lives.</p>\n<p>For example, Tyrion Lannister, brilliantly played by Peter Dinklage, is possibly the most popular and interesting character in Game of Thrones as he plays the role of a dwarf who has all the riches and intellect in the world, yet lacks acceptance and love from a cold (pun intended) Westeros world.</p>\n<p>When Tyrion is spouting sage quotes such as \u201cNever forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you,\u201d it\u2019s hard not to identify with him.</p>\n<p>Perhaps what is most interesting about the show lies in its ability to show both disgusting and redeeming elements of each character which serves to ultimately make us wonder, who really is the \u201cbad\u201d guy anyway?</p>\n<p>As we initially learn to hate characters such as Jaimie Lannister given his incestuous activities, spoiled brat arrogance, and mangling of a little boy, we are pleasantly surprised by his compassionate and heroic actions to save Brienne from a hungry Grizzly Bear.</p>\n<p>When we begin to peel more layers of characters, Game of Thrones does not disappoint as it begins to realistically show that no one can truly \u201chave it all,\u201d as each character is blessed and cursed with their own strengths, weaknesses, and predicaments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jaime Lannister: Suave, good looking, skilled swordsman, and incredibly wealthy\u2026but shoot\u2026his right-hand got chopped off which means everything to a Knight\u2019s identity.</li>\n<li>Tyrion Lannister: Incredibly short, face is slashed, shunned by his own family, yet has the sharpest mind in all of Westeros along with the coin to go along with that wit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I could do this for every single character but I think you get the point. Given how viewers around the world come from varying social classes, cultures, worldviews, etc., there really is a character for everyone.</p>\n<p>As we go on an epic journey with each character and follow their evolution, our minds creatively wonder what we would do in the shoes of the characters we identify with, which leads to feedback and validation as each character\u2019s strengths and flaws unfold.</p>\n<p>As a result, I have to say that Game of Thrones ranks very high on the Creativity core drive as there are so many dimensions of creativity and feedback that occur.</p>\n<h3><b>Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</b></h3>\n<p>While there are many characters that we can find ourselves identifying with, there are also many social issues in the world of Westeros that mirrors our own contemporary issues.</p>\n<p>Typically when we think of the core drive of Epic Meaning &amp; Calling, we think of situations where a player (or in this case viewer) feels that she is a part of something greater than herself.</p>\n<p>In the same vein, thinking about some of the deeper social issues in Game of Thrones allows us to identify with characters such as Daenerys Targaryen (aka the \u201cMother of Dragons\u201d) as she embodies everything a woman can be: caring, compassionate, yet undeniably fierce in a male-dominated world where women are expected to be submissive, bear children, and act as pieces on a chessboard for political conquest.</p>\n<p>Game of Thrones begins with our base needs (violence and sex) on Mavlow\u2019s hierarchy of needs and works its way up towards those controversial and intellectual topics that lie closest to our hearts.</p>\n<p>Just to name a few (you could write whole articles on each of these topics):</p>\n<table width=\"469\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"221\"><b>Social Issues</b></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"248\"><b>Game of Thrones Examples</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"221\"><i>Controversial Relationships: Homosexuality, Incest, Mistresses</i></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"248\">Renly&#8217;s homosexuality, Lannister incest, and Stannis&#8217; mysterious mistress</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"221\"><i>Religion: Faith versus Cold Tactics</i></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"248\">Stannis&#8217; faith in Melisandre&#8217;s God compared to Tywin Lannister&#8217;s tactics tested in battle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"221\"><i>Moral Dilemma: Ends justify the means?</i></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"248\">Stannis&#8217; dilemma: Offer your nephew as sacrifice to gain a Kingdom?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"221\"><i>Modern Day Realism: Lannisters to Wallstreet comparison</i></td>\n<td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"248\">&#8220;Honorable\u201d Starks die (Mainstreet) while conniving Lannisters rule (Wallstreet)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most enduring and recurring theme in Game of Thrones that embodies Epic Meaning &amp; Calling can be attributed to one word\u2026 Duty.</p>\n<p>The idea of Duty is a timeless word that applies to everyone in some shape or form (duty to your family, your country, etc.).</p>\n<p>In the show, John Snow takes up the oath of the Night\u2019s Watch, which requires him to swear to abstinence in the name of honor and the protection of the realm.</p>\n<p>Originally inspired by the notion of taking up arms to guard the realm, John quickly learns the real-world cruelties that lie on the other side of the wall. The words of the ousted Targaryen \u201cWhat is honor compared to a woman\u2019s love?\u201d perfectly embodies the age-old dilemma that has plagued man throughout history in every war.</p>\n<p>Given that Epic Meaning &amp; Calling is so powerfully invoked by both viewers and characters alike, I have to rank this as the third most motivating core drive in Game of Thrones.</p>\n<h3><b>Core Drive 5: Social Pressure &amp; Envy</b></h3>\n<p>Naturally, as each of the previous core drives motivates people to watch this show in ever growing numbers, the word of mouth network effect has ensued and Game of Thrones has quickly become the next hot thing everyone has to watch and read.</p>\n<p>The books, <i>A Song of Fire and Ice</i>, already have a huge fan base from those who love the Dungeon &amp; Dragon genre.</p>\n<p>As the main advocates and early adopters of this show, they have helped to propel Game of Thrones to a sort of \u201ctipping point\u201d where you can\u2019t go two steps anymore in public without seeing someone watching or reading Game of Thrones.</p>\n<p>Other similar examples where this has happened before include <i>DaVinci Code</i>, <i>Harry Potter</i>, <i>Hunger Games, </i>and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>\n<p>While in my mind there is no denying how well written and executed Game of Thrones is; in reality, to most of us, it takes a large network effect for us to see what\u2019s going on primarily due to the Core drive of Social Pressure &amp; Envy.</p>\n<p>As more and more people watch and debate about the show, we naturally want to be a part of the action and feel included in these conversations. (aka Bandwagoning)</p>\n<p>Game of Thrones also became referenced in many other cultural mediums, making everyone feel that they \u201cshould\u201d know what is going on in Game of Thrones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mario-gamification.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3162\" alt=\"Mario Gamification\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mario-gamification.jpg?resize=600%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mario-gamification.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mario-gamification.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>For instance, an image like this might appear in the gamer community, and if you didn\u2019t know what it represented, you could feel a bit obligated to find out.</p>\n<p>In the world of Westeros, social pressure &amp; envy are powerful and deadly forces driving the story of Game of Thrones onwards.</p>\n<p>A lot of emphasis can be seen in class divisions between \u201chigh-born\u201d and \u201clow-born\u201d families as these characters live in a world where the legacy of the family name means everything.</p>\n<p>As a result, an enormous amount of hatred and envy is ever-present in Game of Thrones which can be seen when Jaimie Lannister\u2019s captor slices off his sword hand in bitter resentment of Jaimie exerting his arrogant social status.</p>\n<p>While the previous core drives explains why exactly people enjoy the show, this core drive better explains how Game of Thrones has catapulted into the international spotlight.</p>\n<h3><b>Core Drive 6: Scarcity &amp; Impatience</b></h3>\n<p>With the books already written and each season coming out at a moderate yearly pace due to a focus on high quality \u2013 acting, costumes, scripts, CGI, etc. \u2013 Game of Thrones has become a sort of scarce resource as many of its addicted fans indulge in one episode every Sunday.</p>\n<p>While I usually binge on watching shows myself, Game of Thrones is one show I cannot wait for to finish completely before devouring.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Armed with the knowledge that there is a definitive ending to the show as it aligns with the existing books, audiences inevitably end up treasuring each episode that much more. </span></p>\n<p>A good example of this can be seen by how treasured dragon eggs are in the world of Westeros. Even though the general population believes dragons are extinct, rendering petrified dragon eggs useless, it still serves as a valuable wedding gift due to its rarity and meaning to the Targareyns.</p>\n<h3><b>Core Drive 8: Loss &amp; Avoidance</b></h3>\n<p>Although this Core Drive is not a primary motivation to watch Game of Thrones, it does exist to some degree in the End Game phases as we eventually become increasingly attached to certain characters that we identify with.</p>\n<p>As important characters are killed off, leaving us with a sense of loss and anger, there becomes a deep desire to see vengeance enacted in order to re-balance the karma of Westeros.</p>\n<p>As a result, this core drive indirectly motivates us to continue watching the show as we want to make sure that justice is not lost in this world.</p>\n<h3><b>Core Drive 4: Ownership &amp; Possession</b></h3>\n<p>Again, this core drive is not very prominent in Game of Thrones for viewers; however, it is extremely prominent for characters such as Littlefinger as he slowly accumulates ships, castles, and power.</p>\n<p>With an insatiable appetite to own everything, Littlefinger reveals another subtle theme when he talks about how he always dreamed of owning a ship.</p>\n<p>With not only one ship, but several ships to his name, Littlefinger admits the novelty of owning multiple ships has quickly faded and as a result, he now desires an entire fleet. Basically\u2026more is never enough.</p>\n<h3><strong>Core Drive 2: Development &amp; Accomplishment</strong></h3>\n<p>Lastly, we have the core drive of accomplishment which again does not register much of a punch on the Octalysis Richter scale for viewers as it\u2019s hard to imagine people jumping out of their chairs to level up skills while watching Game of Thrones.</p>\n<p>I suppose if you\u2019re writing an analysis on Game of Thrones like I\u2019m doing right now you could be leveling up your analyzing skills.</p>\n<p>Jokes aside, most people would understandably prefer to sit back and enjoy the show.</p>\n<p>While the spoiled King Joffrey sits back and enjoys shows of brutality, Tyrion Lannister toils in the background by leveling up his intellect and silver-tongue ability by constantly reading and intellectually sparring with his counterparts.</p>\n<p>The core drive of accomplishment becomes painfully clear to Tyrion\u2019s significant other, Shae, as she implores him to escape with her and begin a new life with her far from the back-stabbing environment they fight to survive in on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Tempted for a second by the earnest and caring eyes of Shae, Tyrion offers a sobering explanation as to why he couldn\u2019t possibly leave as so much of his identity and fulfillment stem from his ability to outwit his contemporaries and thrive in the game of politics (thrones).</p>\n<p><b>Octalysis Score:\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Game-of-Thrones-Gamification.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3163\" alt=\"Game of Thrones Gamification\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Game-of-Thrones-Gamification.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Game-of-Thrones-Gamification.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Game-of-Thrones-Gamification.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3><b>Game of Thrones is Winning &amp; Addicting</b></h3>\n<p>After vetting Game of Thrones through an Octalysis analysis, it becomes apparent that those same essentials of screenwriting that make a show great closely mirror the same core drives of a carefully crafted video-game.</p>\n<p>Game of Thrones is strong on the Right Brain Core Drives, and while it lacks some Core Drives in the left brain (this is nowadays solved by innovative Transmedia campaigns like the Suits Recruits), but for the Core Drives it does have are extremely strong. It also uses a good balance between White Hat and Black Hat Gamification.</p>\n<p>Too often Gamification gets a lot of flak for simply being a tool for companies to extract more productivity out of people through \u201cvapor\u201d points.</p>\n<p>While there are many debates on what aspects of Gamification relate to intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation, I think the key take away to focus on is that you can really apply a Gamification or Human-Focused Octalysis to any piece of culture in life that has the ability to capture and inspire our attention.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we are doing the same thing Psychology does by creating a definition for every phenomenon we observe; however, I really do believe strongly that breaking down all the elements of what truly motivates people and harnessing it into a set of tools to reinvigorate un-motivated bureaucratic segments of our society can be the answer to our societal and economic woes.</p>\n<p>As an exercise, I challenge you to think of any hobby, work, entertainment, etc. that truly interests and motivates you and rate it on an Octalysis scale. I\u2019m willing to bet that your own personal hobbies will rate strongly on Octalysis.</p>\n<p>As a tool, we can then harness this analysis to focus on institutions that poorly engage people and re-vamp them to naturally re-invigorate motivation rather than focusing on the old tools of carrots and sticks.</p>\n<p>If you happen to be stuck in the drudgeries of corporate America and are trying to trick yourself into motivation, remember Syrio Forel\u2019s words \u201cThe heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time for a change America. Winter is coming.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gamification-Winter-is-Coming.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3164\" alt=\"Gamification Winter is Coming\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gamification-Winter-is-Coming.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gamification-Winter-is-Coming.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gamification-Winter-is-Coming.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n",

We like to imagination, invent, and create, and both the process and outcome of the process brings happiness.</li>\n<li>Think about games like Minecraft and Second Life.</li>\n<li>Games like that are engaging because it allows you to create your own world, your shelter, and even your own looks.</li>\n<li>Other social games like Draw Something (at least in the early scaffolding phase) as well as plants vs zombie.</li>\n<li>Draw Something was fun for a long time because it allowed both sides to utilize their creativity and see immediate results.</li>\n<li>The reason why it eventually dropped out was because of lack of fresh content (or challenges) and how people could just start to game the system by writing in the correct word.</li>\n<li>That&#8217;s another good lesson in Gamification: when a system is &#8220;gamable&#8221; it devalues the experience of those who are doing honest play and demoralizes the players.</li>\n<li>Plants vs Zombies, like any other &#8220;tower-defense&#8221; game, is about utilizing current resources and &#8220;plants&#8221; to solve a puzzle of zombie attacks. This allows people to utilize their creativity to create different solutions to solve the same problem, making it fun for each player to engage in the longterm.</li>\n<li>I mentioned that in Farmville, one of the best evergreen mechanics they have is the ability to allow users to <a title=\"Farmville Gamification\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/farmville-game-mechanics-winning-addicting/\" target=\"_blank\">make art with their farms</a>.</li>\n<li>Even in the RPG game <a title=\"Gamification Research: How Diablo III uses Game Mechanics to become Winning &amp; Addicting\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/diablo-iii-gamification-winning-addicting/\" target=\"_blank\">Diablo III</a>, during the Onboarding and Scaffolding Phase, there&#8217;s a lot of Core Drive 1 (<a title=\"The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Gamification (8 of 90): Core Drive \u2013 Epic Meaning &amp; Calling\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/beginners-guide-to-gamification/beginners-guide-gamification-8-90-core-drive-epic-meaning-calling/\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</a>), Core Drive 2 (<a title=\"The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Gamification (9 of 90): Core Drive \u2013 Development &amp; Accomplishment\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-video-course/beginners-guide-gamification-9-90-core-drive-development-accomplishment/\" target=\"_blank\">Development &amp; Accomplishment</a>), Core Drive 5 (<a title=\"The 8 Core Drives of Gamification (#5): Social Pressure &amp; Envy\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-of-gamification-5-social-pressure-and-envy/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Pressure &amp; Envy</a>), Core Drive 6 (<a title=\"The 8 Core Drives of Gamification (#6): Scarcity &amp; Impatience\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-core-drives-gamification-6-scarcity-impatience/\" target=\"_blank\">Scarcity &amp; Impatience</a>), but during the EndGame stage, Core Drive 3 (as well as Core Drive 4 and <a title=\"The 8 Core Drives of Gamification (#8): Loss &amp; Avoidance\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-study/8-loss-and-avoidance/\" target=\"_blank\">Core Drive 8</a>) become dominant.\u00a0<!--more--></li>\n<li>Once a player reaches a high level, he would constantly think up new ways to play the game better, matching different skill combos, passive skills, boosters, as well as gear to create the ultimate effect in increasing DPS (damage per second), being a tank, life leech sustainability, or minion strength.</li>\n<li>That process would drive many players to pull out excel spreadsheets to calculate the optimal combination of everything, try it out, and adjust accordingly. (Yes, there are a group of gamers online that heavily use excel spreadsheets to play games better.)</li>\n<li>When a game or a product can get users to voluntarily pull excel out and figure out how to optimize your performance, I would say it does this Core Drive pretty successfully.</li>\n<li>Even though this Core Drive can be the most powerful, it is the hardest to implement into a company product &#8211; primarily because it involves attention and commitment.</li>\n<li>Most people these days have short attention spans, and unless you design your Discovery and Onboarding phase well, people will not want to commit their attention to play the game.</li>\n<li>Often times other gamification experts like Sebastian Deterding (and Jane McGonigal) claim that Gamification does not nearly reach its promise, and prefers terms like &#8220;Gameful Design&#8221; as an ascended form of gamification. However, for the examples they list out relating to fun, learning, mastery, and problem-solving, it&#8217;s mostly because they prefer a higher emphasis of the Core Drive Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback, which as mentioned is the hardest to implement correctly.</li>\n<li>Some great examples happen in the crowdsourcing space, where a large group of people with a diverse set of backgrounds would solve one problem.</li>\n<li>My favorite has been Foldit, where a 15-Year AIDS problem was solved within 10 days.</li>\n<li>DIY.org gets kids to learn by <a title=\"Vimeo\" href=\" http://vimeo.com/51529828#at=0 \" target=\"_blank\">empowering them to do and create many things</a></li>\n<li>Even in the work place, when you empower your workers to utilize their creativity and see feedback quickly, you have engaged workers.</li>\n<li>Many corporate workers have talked to me before about being an entrepreneur simply because it&#8217;s frustrating seeing feedback for their ideas 10 months after proposing it through the bureaucratic situation.</li>\n<li>Google&#8217;s 20% time allowed employees to express their creativity through other projects and see results quickly.</li>\n<li>When utilizing Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback, it is important to note a few things:</li>\n<li><a title=\"Flow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\" target=\"_blank\">Flow</a>:\u00a0There must be a balance between the learning curve and the challenge. If something is too hard, players withdraw or get anxiety. If it is too boring, players feel bored and leave. A good gamification (and game) designer needs to make sure the flow for Core Drive 3 is well aligned to maximize engagement.</li>\n<li>Boosters:\u00a0A good way to add Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback into a design is through what I call Boosters (#31), basically things that make progress easier.</li>\n<li>The reason why boosters are effective is because players now have to plan what type of boosters to obtain through what activities</li>\n<li>An example of this is when users are accumulating &#8220;points&#8221; on a site, but when the site offers badges/trophies or &#8220;knowledge scores&#8221; that can superboost points acquisition, users start to plan out how to obtain the right badges/trophies to fulfill their objective better.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion on the 3rd Core Drive of Gamification:</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s always good to incorporate as many core drives into a design as possible. Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback is great because it gets users to discover their creative beings, inspires people, and can become evergreen mechanics that keep the users engaged for long periods of time.</p>\n",

On the other hand, if you have a sub-3 rating on Yelp, then Yelp can destroy your business. The ratings and stars is a good example of gamification, a booming trend. (Click here to see <a title=\"What is Gamification\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/what-is-gamification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What is Gamification</a>)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s therefore important to not only get a lot of reviews on Yelp, but to make sure they&#8217;re positive reviews. \u00a0This post will cover how to increase your review count, while a future post will cover how to make sure these Yelp reviews are positive.</p>\n<p><strong>Who should read this post</strong>: local business owner that are looking to increase their Yelp reviews</p>\n<p><strong>Why you will learn</strong>: how to get customers to leave you more Yelp reviews</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>1. Post Yelp signage</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-598\" title=\"find-us-on-yelp\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/find-us-on-yelp.png?resize=373%2C319&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"373\" height=\"319\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Obvious and effective. \u00a0Post a sign at your location to encourage your customers to find your business on Yelp. \u00a0Now that more and more customers have a smartphone, customers can write a review while they&#8217;re shopping or dining at your location.</p>\n<h3>2. Post your positive Yelp reviews at your business</h3>\n<p>This is very very effective.</p>\n<p>I saw this used at one of my favorite vegetarian fast-casual restaurants in Irvine, CA. \u00a0They printed and framed their best Yelp reviews and posted them inside of the restaurant so you can see them while waiting in line to order. \u00a0Furthermore, the frame looked very exquisite and they blew up the reviews to 10x their size so that it&#8217;s very easy to read.</p>\n<p>This technique has two very positive results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Other Yelpers realize that this place is highly reviewed and worth reviewing, so they&#8217;ll take the time to review it as well</li>\n<li>People in line will feel very positive while waiting in line and the taste of the food will be that much better because they expect it to be great, leading to positive reviews</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>3. Offer a special reward to the Foursquare mayor</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-600\" title=\"foursquare-mayor-rewards\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/foursquare-mayor-rewards.png?resize=500%2C375&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Yelpers are highly likely to use other social media service such as Foursquare. \u00a0Therefore, the more Foursquare users that you attract, the higher the chance that you&#8217;re attracting people that leave reviews on Yelp.</p>\n<p>Fourquare users must also take out their phone in order to check-in. \u00a0If they&#8217;re taking out their phone to check-in, they may also take out their phone to review your business on Yelp. \u00a0Increase your chance of Yelp reviews by getting more Foursquare users.</p>\n<h3>4. Host a Yelp event</h3>\n<p>Another obvious and VERY effective way to boost your Yelp ratings. \u00a0Take the following steps to hold a fun Yelp event with many Yelpers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Interact with your current Yelpers (the users that have already reviewed your business on Yelp)</li>\n<li>Interact with Yelpers that have reviewed a similar business to yours</li>\n<li>Contact your local <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/elite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yelp Elite </a>member to let him know that you&#8217;re looking to host a Yelp event and that you&#8217;re looking to work with him to host it</li>\n<li>Create a a web-form with <a href=\"http://wufoo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wufoo</a> and invite Yelpers to RSVP for your event</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>5. Collect emails and request reviews in the footer</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a good idea to collect emails.</p>\n<p>Do NOT send an email just to ask for Yelp reviews &#8211; this can have negative consequences and makes you look like a needy business owner. \u00a0Instead, make the ask passive.</p>\n<p>In the footer of your emails, create a link to your Yelp page:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let us know your feedback on Yelp! Over 100 others have already!!!</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Each step above takes investment on your part. \u00a0If you\u00a0hustle, have excellent food and service, and constantly remind your customers to review you on Yelp, then you will greatly increase your reviews and see a very positive increase in foot traffic to your business.</p>\n",

Check out his blog at <a title=\"Create and Innovate\" href=\"http://www.josephayi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Create &amp; Innovate!</a>)</em></p>\n<p>For food lovers, the <a title=\"McDonalds Breakfast Menu\" href=\"http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/breakfast.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">McDonald&#8217;s Breakfast Menu</a> is the equivalent of diamond. Everyone wants it, but not everyone can have it. Hard to come by and unique, those lucky enough to wake up for it savor each bite, while those who are not so lucky ask the question &#8220;Why not serve it all day?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Starting with the <a title=\"Egg McMuffin Ad\" href=\"http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/egg-mcmuffin-ad-egg-mcmuffin-ads-137501\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Egg McMuffin</a> in 1972, McDonald&#8217;s pioneered breakfast fast food by providing a quick and easy way for consumers to have the &#8216;most important meal of the day.&#8217; In the United States, most McDonald locations stop serving the McMuffin and their breakfast menu at 10:30AM, with a few stopping at 11:00AM on weekends.</p>\n<p>While many fast food and <a title=\"Top 50 QSR Chains\" href=\"http://www.qsrmagazine.com/reports/2011-qsr-50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">QSR chains</a> have expanded their breakfast menu hours to run all day, most notably <a title=\"Jack in the Box\" href=\"http://www.jackinthebox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jack in the Box</a>, McDonald&#8217;s remains one of the few chain restaurants to serve breakfast only during morning hours, and for good reason. While there are obvious economic reasons in play, such as the differing cooking temperatures for breakfast items vs. lunch items (ie: hamburger patties vs. eggs) and extra staffing requirements, from a marketing and branding standpoint, McDonald&#8217;s is an excellent <a title=\"What is Gamification\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/what-is-gamification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">example of Gamification</a>\u00a0and how not serving it all day has it&#8217;s benefits.\u00a0 <strong></strong></p>\n<h3>The Law of Scarcity<!--more--></h3>\n<p>The Law of Scarcity states that when a person perceives that something or someone that they want is in limited quantity that the value of the object will be greater than if it were to be abundant and available.</p>\n<p>To clearly understand this, we will use shoes as an example, specifically the Nike Air Jordan brand.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-517 aligncenter\" title=\"Law of Scarcity - Air Jordan\" alt=\"Law of Scarcity - Air Jordan\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Law-of-Scarcity-Air-Jordan.jpg?resize=497%2C182&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"497\" height=\"182\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Often the most sought out pairs of shoes when released, the Nike Air Jordan brand was fueled not only by an iconic brand in Michael Jordan, but by a marketing strategy built to drive demand. Rather than produce pairs of shoes based on the demand of the market, Nike often produces a set number of Air Jordans. Regardless of demand for them, Nike brands Air Jordan&#8217;s as &#8220;get them while you can&#8221; products. No matter the outcry and consumer demand, the scarcity and difficulty in acquiring a pair of Air Jordans is what makes it so appealing.</p>\n<p>Circle back now to McDonald&#8217;s and wee see the same sort of effect. Yes, McDonald&#8217;s may sell more by changing the hours during which they offer their breakfast menu, but just how Air Jordan&#8217;s have branded themselves as the exclusive shoe for basketball enthusiasts, so has McDonald&#8217;s in becoming the go-to fast food destination for breakfast.</p>\n<h3>How To Create Market Demand For Your Product</h3>\n<p>You may not have an Egg McMuffin or a fresh pair of Jordans, but there are still plenty of ways to create a demand for your product.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What&#8217;s the emotional connection?</strong>The best kind of marketing is the kind that creates an emotional reaction. <a title=\"TOMS Shoes\" href=\"http://www.proofbranding.com/branding/more-than-just-toms-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TOMS Shoes</a>for example has a great story behind their product:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"TOMS Shoes - Emotional Message\" alt=\"TOMS Shoes - Emotional Message\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TOMS-Shoes-Emotional-Message.jpg?resize=487%2C116&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"487\" height=\"116\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><strong>With Every Pair You Purchase, TOMS Will Help a Person in Need.<br />\nOne for One.</strong></p>\n<p>In building a very profitable business, TOMS pulls at the emotional strings of consumers by tying purchases with goodwill. Remember: there is always a story to tell with your product. From how people use it to how it is helping do good, sometimes the key is just to dig a little.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Hype</strong>One of the most effective strategies in creating market demand is to build hype before it even launches. Just how cars brands will provide &#8216;sneak peaks&#8217; of new models, consider &#8216;teasing&#8217; new products and ideas to your community to generate buzz and interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Be original</strong>The concept is simple, yet getting there can be much harder. Going back to our example of McDonald&#8217;s and their breakfast menu, one will note the originality in their products. Most fast food chains have the same standard breakfast items like the others, but only McDonald&#8217;s has the Egg McMuffin and Big Breakfast.Look at your competitors and see what they are doing. It&#8217;s easy to copy what they are doing, but what will separate you from the rest and create a demand for your product is how it stands out amongst the competition.</li>\n<li><strong>Limit the opportunity</strong>Another example that we can take away from McDonald&#8217;s is the McRib. Comprised of a pork patty, barbecue sauce, onions, and pickles served on a 5\u00bd inch roll, the McRib has become a cult favorite. Served just a time during the calendar year, McDonald&#8217;s took this once dying menu item and created a demand for it by introducing creative campaigns such as the &#8220;<a title=\"McRib Farewell tour\" href=\"http://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/online-marketing-bolsters-mcrib-farewell-tour-baskin-robbins-birthday-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Farewell McRib Tour</a>.&#8221;<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-543 aligncenter\" title=\"Farewell McRib Tour\" alt=\"Farewell McRib Tour\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/McRib.jpg?resize=425%2C302&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"425\" height=\"302\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\nTaking a tip out of the McDonald&#8217;s playbook, limiting the opportunity of a new product or feature is a great way to create a reaction by the market to &#8216;buy while they still can.&#8217;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Just like McDonald&#8217;s and their breakfast menu, taking simple products and turning them into &#8216;high-demand&#8217; commodities is all about strategy and planning. Let us know what you think about McDonald&#8217;s marketing strategy for their breakfast menu as well as any others that you think are worth mentioning in the comment section below.</p>\n",

With the new results this month, it is a pleasant surprise to see me improved to Number 4.</p>\n<p>As you know, I am a VERY competitive gamer. And once I take a game seriously, I go all out on it. It is the same for climbing the gamification guru ladders. However, I&#8217;m still very behind with a bunch of my work, as you probably notice a slowness on updating my blog as well as getting out the next episode of\u00a0Video Series: <a title=\"Beginner's Guide to Gamification\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/video-guide\" target=\"_blank\">The Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification</a>. Truth be told, I went to Chicago and accumulated a bunch of amazing footage. But due to a faulty iPhone upgrade, I lost all that footage and so became a little bit demoralized. I&#8217;ll be picking it up again soon though (as well as remaking the long-awaited episode 3).</p>\n<p>Either way, I&#8217;m just grateful I&#8217;m on the list to begin with. Hopefully this means later on when this bug is gone, I will be able to ascend into a higher realm of guru-ship.</p>\n<p><!--more-->In the past 3-4 months, my <a title=\"Octalysis: Complete Gamification Framework\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-research/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\">Gamification Framework called Octalysis</a> got picked up very well and was translated into 6 different languages across Europe and South America. I also received a decent amount of speaking opportunities, workshops, and consulting engagements with cool startups as well as Fortune 500s. I feel very blessed to have gotten such recognition in such a short amount of time and feel immensely thankful for those who supported me and gave me confidence and strength to continue to share my knowledge while having fun at the same time.<a title=\"Octalysis: Complete Gamification Framework\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-research/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\"><br />\n</a></p>\n<p>On the other hand, I have the honor of being one of the hosts for the premium Gamification Conference of the year- GSummit.

The founder <a title=\"Toby Beresford\" href=\"http://gamificationofwork.com/author/toby/\">Toby Beresford</a> was kind enough to address that and said, &#8220;Apologies to [Yu-kai Chou] who it seems fell foul of some arbitrary twitter garden hose sharding this month. It meant I didn\u2019t pick up his tweets yet I did pick up his retweets. We\u2019re upgrading to a full firehose soon which should put a stop to this problem but it\u2019s not plugged in yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m just grateful I&#8217;m on the list to begin with.

People also care more about socializing.</li>\n<li>A sense of scarcity and impatience occupies the user: I want to have that avatar I can&#8217;t get!!</li>\n<li>But more importantly, a sense of ownership and possession takes over.</li>\n<li>The user eventually learns that Waze is constantly learning about her, her preferences, and her driving habits. You will start to see pop ups that ask, &#8220;do you want to drive to work now?&#8221; Because it knows you drive to work between 9:30-10am.</li>\n<li>It also knows whether her favorite type of men are driving close by and exactly where they are.</li>\n<li>Just kidding. Waze hasn&#8217;t gotten itself into the geolocation dating market yet. But it may be neat. Check it out, an 82% match willing to carpool with me to work! Awesome! This is great for busy professions that only have time to date when they are driving to work.</li>\n<li>Plus, you actually can get the second date very easily&#8230;and usually on the same day&#8230;.when you get off work.</li>\n<li>Anyway, back to our Octalysis: as we find out that Waze is learning about ourselves, we start to feel that this is &#8220;MY WAZE.&#8221; The GPS that understands you and caters driving to you. By driving a lot with it, you have established yourself a place in the world of Waze that no one can replicate!</li>\n<li>And at this point, you start to use Waze even more because you want it to learn more about you!</li>\n<li>There&#8217;s another secret little core drive that takes a place here in why people want to use Waze: curiosity and unpredictability</li>\n<li>When you see an alert about a cop or trash on the road, there&#8217;s a slight mindset in thinking, &#8220;I wonder if its going to be there when I get there.&#8221;</li>\n<li>And if you drive for another 10 seconds and you see it, you get an endorphin shot. &#8220;It is here!&#8221;</li>\n<li>Of course, when its not, it&#8217;s like &#8220;meh&#8230;maybe next time I find it!&#8221; Just like when you lose on a gambling round. There&#8217;s a certain type of Reward Loop system here that is similar to loot and drops from RPG Games.</li>\n<li>Now keep in mind, all this stuff is NECESSARY for an app like Waze, because it is user generated. It&#8217;s not a good product on its own, and it continuously needs people to use it actually be a functional product, especially in new cities where there are not a lot of wazers around!</li>\n<li>I have a good friend who told me, &#8220;I use Waze because its useful, not because it has game mechanics and stuff like that.&#8221; And my response is that Waze is not useful for those who contribute data. It&#8217;s only useful for those who take advantage of such data. And in that sense, GPS apps like Scout is more accurate and can do a lot more, because it doesn&#8217;t depend on &#8220;user motivation.&#8221;</li>\n<li>If fact, there were 3 times where Waze took me to the entire wrong place and made me late for meeting for 10-40 minutes! If it was any other navigation app, a user&#8217;s first thought would be, &#8220;dude this is trash. I&#8217;m never going to use this again!&#8221;</li>\n<li>But the power of what Waze had accomplished is that many of the users would say, &#8220;oh crap! There&#8217;s a map flaw! I need to help fix it so that others don&#8217;t go to the wrong place too!&#8221; How can you get people to do things like just because you are &#8220;useful&#8221; and not something that is designed to motivate and engage the human mind?</li>\n<li>And finally. We approach the endgame.</li>\n<li>The endgame is for power users that have done everything there is to do on Waze and have used it regularly for over a year</li>\n<li>For these people, their sense of Humanity Hero is no longer with every driver on the street, but to help new wazers help others.</li>\n<li>At that point, since they have collected a lot of points without caring too much about them, they now can see they are relatively close to something cool, and will try to reach for those hard-to-get virtual goods.</li>\n<li>Instead of just reporting map errors. they now also help fix the maps so others won&#8217;t get confused.</li>\n<li>They strike up more conversations with fellow wazers and try to build a community, and they also become evangelists to get all their friends to sign up.</li>\n<li>And of course, with all that custom preference knowledge being built up by Waze, As well as those points, there is a HIGH degree of Loss &amp; Avoidance because endgame users want to avoid the &#8220;sunk cost tragedy&#8221; where they feel all the time they &#8220;invested&#8221; into Waze would be wasted. As a result, Waze has a strong sense of user retention (until it takes you to the wrong place again)</li>\n<li>So now that we have all 8 Core Drives analyzed, lets start to plot things out!</li>\n<li>So Waze has an Octalysis Score of 244!</li>\n<li>With this, you can also see what is it strong at and weak at, which part of the brain, and which code drives can improve.</li>\n<li>Once you have this plotted out, you can often come up with actionable steps to add better game mechanics into the system that seemlessly motivates people to use it even more.</li>\n<li>If you understood everything I talked about in this episode, congratulations, you now qualify as a Level 1 Octalysis Gamifier.</li>\n<li>You can now perform simple Octalysis on anything in the market and better gamify your product and services.</li>\n<li>There is a total of 5 Levels within Octalysis, where Level 5 is ridiculously complex but amazingly powerful to figure every little detail about a Gamification campaign.</li>\n<li>Alright, that concludes our episode for the Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Consider this Closed Caption for the Hearing Impaired :P):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hello Everyone, and welcome to the Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification, Episode number 6! This is Yu-Kai Chou, and I&#8217;m excited to get the game started!\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.blogdash.com/full_profile/?claim_code=7332d2be2c2b711f1410dfd3d4f50f5d\" target=\"_blank\"><br />\n</a></li>\n<li>Today we&#8217;re going to go through an example of Octalysis.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;re going to look at the Navigation App Waze</li>\n<li>Waze takes an otherwise boring GPS concept, you know, you turn left and turn right and get to your destination, and turn it into something fun and engaging.</li>\n<li>They did such a good job that they have a five-star average rating from thousands and thousands of people.</li>\n<li>Lets check out how they did it!</li>\n<li>Here we always start off with Octalysis, with Waze in the middle. We first think about the Discovery Phase, how do people find out about the app?</li>\n<li>Generally people find out about the app because they are driving and they searched for a GPS/Navigation. Their friends might say how awesome it is, or through Tech Crunch.</li>\n<li>First of all, Waze has the general appeal of any GPS, which is development and accomplishment &#8211; you feel good making progress towards your destination (like a progress bar), and you feel accomplished reaching the goal in time. If you can beat traffic when doing that, it makes you feel even smarter and accomplished.</li>\n<li>On the flip side of that, it obviously literally appeals to the core drive of Loss and Avoidance. You don&#8217;t want to get lost.</li>\n<li>But more than that, why would someone choose Waze over other navigation apps?<!--more--></li>\n<li>That&#8217;s where Curiosity and Unpredictability is a strong drive. People are curious about the little friendly icon, as well as the concept of Waze.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Interesting! A user generated Navigation App! How does that work??</li>\n<li>Finally, Waze made a large effort to make driving together FUN.</li>\n<li>You can drive together and see where your friends are. So your friends are inviting you to use Waze to figure out where to pick you up, to brag about beating you in traffic, and prepare dinner 10 minutes before you arrive at a party.</li>\n<li>And of course, the more people using it, the better the data.</li>\n<li>By design, Waze makes people Want to get friends to use it.</li>\n<li>Once you download Waze, it quickly jumps into the Onboarding phase of a Game.</li>\n<li>\u00a0As you can see, it starts heavily on Epic Meaning and Calling, implementing a game mechanic I call the Humanity Hero.</li>\n<li>Check out this graph. Waze installs a sense of mission and meaning by presenting all the drivers as chivalrous knights battling this monster called Traffic.</li>\n<li>In that sense, you are not just driving to a place. You are protecting mankind against a monster, and now you feel obligated to drive with Waze on to contribute to the community too.</li>\n<li>At this stage, you will also see cute graphics that make it playful, and big buttons to make you \u00a0feel accomplished.</li>\n<li>The various avatars you can have and other friendly wazers and little candies you can eat at this point looks interesting, but it doesn&#8217;t drive user behavior yet, and it could even be a little distracting.</li>\n<li>You also Don&#8217;t want to invite your friends yet</li>\n<li>In fact, for most apps, no one wants to invite their friends until they are in the Scaffolding phase.</li>\n<li>So you all should stop harrassing your users when they first join!!</li>\n<li>However, upon driving for a little bit, you will start to see the work of the community:</li>\n<li>Warning: there&#8217;s crap ahead on the road!</li>\n<li>Warning: there&#8217;s heavy traffic ahead!</li>\n<li>Warning: there&#8217;s a cop ahead!</li>\n<li>This is where you get your first feeling of:</li>\n<li>&#8220;Hey, this is kinda cool!&#8221;</li>\n<li>You now feel accomplished and smart as you gain some intel from this &#8220;community.&#8221;</li>\n<li>This is a feeling you don&#8217;t get from other navigation apps.</li>\n<li>When you benefit a few times from &#8220;user contribution, you suddenly feel a sense of giving back, depending on what player type are you.</li>\n<li>This is what I call the thank you economy, I term that Gary Vaynerchuk coined.</li>\n<li>Go check out his book- it&#8217;s awesome and crushing it.</li>\n<li>Any way, you start to share a bit about the car on the side of the road.</li>\n<li>And this is when &#8220;Walla!! You got some contribution points!!&#8221; You did something that you believe is good for the community, and you were awarded points for it. You now feel doubly good about yourself.</li>\n<li>And then suddenly, a stranger who is also driving thanked you for your contribution.</li>\n<li>Woot!! That was fun! You now feel triply good about yourself.</li>\n<li>You now have a sense of well being.</li>\n<li>&#8220;That was a fun driving experience!&#8221;</li>\n<li>You have successfully completed the Onboarding process and you are ready to come back the next time you drive</li>\n<li>Oh, and time to leave a 5 star positive feedback!</li>\n<li>This is also the best time to send users a message: &#8220;Waze is more fun with friends! Invite your friends now so you can do XYZ together!!&#8221;</li>\n<li>Now is the time for scaffolding.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, due to lack of time, we will be ending our episode here.</li>\n<li>Be sure to catch the next episode!! (Who reads this btw?)</li>\n</ul>\n",

Most recently on Nov 14-21st, 2012, the Israel Defense Force started <a title=\"Operation Pillar of Defense\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pillar_of_Defense\" target=\"_blank\">Operations Pillar of Defense</a>, where it launched an attack on the Gaza Strips, supposedly as a response to the <a title=\"Palestinian Rocket Attacks\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel\" target=\"_blank\">8,600 and more Rockets that were fired into Israel from the other side</a> between 2001 and 2009, and <a title=\"IDF Blog\" href=\"http://www.idfblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">1000 more rockets this year alone</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, IDF introduced many game mechanics and gamification techniques on their website in the form of <a title=\"IDF Ranks\" href=\"http://www.idfblog.com/idf-ranks-game/#\" target=\"_blank\">IDF Ranks</a>. This is a game that is meant to stir up patriotism  and get Israelites (and other nations) to stand up and support their efforts.</p>\n<p>Users get points by reading, commenting, watching, and sharing information and updates they post on the websites and level up into different ranks, as well as earn badges. This will also allow regular civillians to feel like they are contributing to the war effort and helping their country.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the social media world pounced on that with strong criticism. It is covered by publications like <a title=\"Time\" href=\"http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/16/the-war-will-be-gamified-israel-hamas-in-social-media-struggle/\" target=\"_blank\">Time</a>, Gamespot, and more. <a title=\"ReadWriteWeb\" href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/15/unbelievable-the-idf-has-gamified-its-war-blog\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Mitchell at ReadwriteWeb</a> wrote, \u201cInnocent people are dying on all sides, and the IDF wants to reward people for tweeting about it&#8230;It makes me sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>This post is about why I think, as controversial as it may be, IDF has the RIGHT to gamify their war efforts.</p>\n<h3>What this post is NOT about</h3>\n<p>Before anything, I want to say that this post is NOT about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promoting war, or saying war is fun. Just like Jon Mitchell said, war itself is horrible, with innocent people dying on all sides. I do NOT like war. I abhor it, and feel sad about all the killed/injured people and their family members in any war.</li>\n<li>Who is right or wrong. I&#8217;m not going to make a moral judgement on which side is right.  People fight wars for various reasons (In fact, weren&#8217;t we the United States just in a &#8220;war&#8221; recently?), and as a Gamification Professional, I&#8217;m going to leave my political opinons on this aside. This post is merely on whether gamifying war efforts, GIVEN that a nation is in a war, violates codes of basic morality or &#8220;taste.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Evaluating how GOOD the gamification actually is from the IDF. Even though the gamification efforts from IDF isn&#8217;t very well designed and implemented from a professional opinon, this post is about whether they should do it or not in the first place instead of how well they do it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now with that aside&#8230;</p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s the other way around: most games were created to MIMIC war</h3>\n<p>You know how <a title=\"What is Gamification\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-research/gamification/\" target=\"_blank\">Gamification is applying game elements into non-game context</a>? Well guess what: most games since the very beginning are simply applying war elements into non-war context.</p>\n<p>War has been around for as long as there are people. Operations and practices of war have long been around before games appeared, and they&#8217;re basically all about defending/invading nations, staying alive, and keeping soldiers motivated.</p>\n<p>Soldiers have naturally been keeping score or &#8220;points&#8221; based on how many enemies they have killed. Some warriors in various cultures hang their enemies&#8217; skulls on themselves as trophies, while others &#8220;capture enemy flags&#8221; to keep score and  showoff their victories and inspire their entire armies.</p>\n<p>These practices are accepted in their respective cultures because war is serious, gruesome, and has devastating consequences if lost. There must be ways to motivate soldiers who are going through dreadful lifestyles, missing their families, and risking their lives everyday. And the way to do it is to have them focus on their enemies as well as their own progress and accomplishments in a battle.</p>\n<p>These things are very necessary to win a war (again, losing has devastating consequences), so <strong>instead of feeling distaste because of wars that use game mechanics, shouldn&#8217;t it be more valid to say that it is sick and distasteful that games are modeled after wars?</strong></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the most popular win-state to gain points, experience, or trophies in games? Enemies destroyed.</p>\n<p>Pretending to be in a war when we&#8217;re actually not is arguably the sick part of our psych, as opposed to pretending we&#8217;re in a game during war to keep morale up and make things more bearable.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, and where do games get the concept of &#8220;badges&#8221; from in the first place? The military of course. When a soldier has accomplished many missions, he gains a badge that represents recognition and honor.</strong></p>\n<p>Is it sickening that we are recognizing and honoring people who likely have taken lives away from people?</p>\n<h3>Self-Defense has no rules</h3>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Again, in this post I&#8217;m not saying which side is right, or which side started it all. But the truth of the matter is, Israel right now is being bombarded by rockets (even if they exaggerate the numbers), and so they must find ways to protect themselves from their enemies and save their own people.</p>\n<p>Some countries call their military departments the &#8220;Defense&#8221; when in fact they are usually the aggressor and attack for economic reasons (one particular country is top of mind), but I believe in this case, Israel&#8217;s military is truly focused on Defense (of course, both countries next door to each other could both be defending).</p>\n<p><strong>When you are defending yourself, you are doing all sorts of things to stay alive. For one, you kill. You not only kill, you train people to kill, and you also spend hard-earned tax dollars to kill.</strong> Can you argue that all of that stuff is &#8220;distasteful&#8221; when the goal is to defend your nation?</p>\n<p>When the <a title=\"Twin Towers\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center\" target=\"_blank\">Twin Towers fell</a>, and the U.S. decided that it was under attack and needed &#8220;Defense,&#8221; did it not do things that were radical? It started to place everyone&#8217;s privacy as a secondary goal; it recruited, trained (to kill), and sent soldiers to attack Afganistan, while most likely vilifying the &#8220;enemies&#8221; in an unfair manner; and for some reason, it also sent the troops to Iraq too, all the way until the U.S. finally declared itself &#8220;safe&#8221; and no longer needed the Defense.</p>\n<p><strong>And what happened when people found out Bin Laden was killed?</strong> Below is a excerpt from <a title=\"Wikipedia Bin Laden\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Osama_bin_Laden#Reactions\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Before the official announcement, large crowds spontaneously gathered outside the White House, Ground Zero, The Pentagonand in New York&#8217;s Times Square to celebrate. [&#8230;] As news of bin Laden&#8217;s death filtered through the crowd at a nationally televised Major League Baseball game in Philadelphia between rivals Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets, &#8220;U-S-A!&#8221; cheers began.</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bin-Laden-War-Gamification.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2463\" title=\"Bin Laden War Gamification\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bin-Laden-War-Gamification.jpg?resize=420%2C250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bin Laden War Gamification\" width=\"420\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bin-Laden-War-Gamification.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bin-Laden-War-Gamification.jpg?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Would you say that it is sick and distasteful when everyone is cheering for a man&#8217;s death? For those who commented that &#8220;Sharing the news about assassinating an enemy leader on Twitter is SICK,&#8221; did you know that during Obama&#8217;s speech about Bin Laden&#8217;s death, there were 5000 tweets PER SECOND about it? Many would argue that this is justified and righteous because we are simply defending against and retaliating to an enemy that deserves it.</p>\n<p>Again, this is all from ONE attack.</p>\n<p>Now imagine if we were attacked by rockets every single week, how would a nation like the U.S. respond?</p>\n<p>When a nation is actually in a state of constant danger, what place do nations at relative peace have to say about how &#8220;brass&#8221; their war efforts are, especially when its just a way to structure their websites and communities, as opposed to other REALLY bad things you can do in &#8220;self-defense,&#8221; such as torture or even worse things?</p>\n<h3>Gamification is the least sickening thing you can do to facilitate a war</h3>\n<p>War is cruel, and there are many things nations do to win a war. Some countries send spies; some countries sabotage the other country&#8217;s economy by dumping currencies; some assassin the leaders; some tortue prisoners; some just build a really big bomb and drop it.</p>\n<p>If turning your website into a system that originated from war in the first place can motivate people to read it, and if somehow reading articles, commenting, and sharing things on Twitter can ACTUALLY help a country win a war, I would say that this is the most peaceful, benevolent, and effective war tactic I have ever seen.</p>\n<p>Video Games are proven to be effective in motivating behavior, which is the entire premise of the Gamification Industry. And the U.S. recognizes that too with many studies and <a title=\"Airfoce\" href=\"http://www.gamification.co/2012/11/30/the-air-force-gamifies-recruitment-with-the-airman-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\">games that help the US Air Force recruit talent</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, Gamification is just a tool to achieve desired goals, just like cars, Twitter, and the Internet. <strong>It wouldn&#8217;t be distasteful if Israel used Twitter, vehicles, or the Internet to facilitate their war efforts. If fact, it would be STUPID for them not to do it. So why not Gamification then?</strong></p>\n<h3>Having a Right to Gamify</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying every country SHOULD gamify their war sites, nor am I saying that Israel SHOULD do it. My point is that there is NOTHING wrong with Israel doing it to defend itself.</p>\n<p>We are not under constant threat by surrounding nations, so we shouldn&#8217;t pretend to know what it&#8217;s like being in that state and make judgements on their morality or taste when they are just trying to survive through fear and devastation.</p>\n",

That was shared and spread on every platform possible, and was one of the most common conversation starters during the time (Of course, those conversation starters later moved on into <a title=\"Friday\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0\" target=\"_blank\">Rebecca Black&#8217;s &#8220;Friday&#8221;</a> and the wonderful Korean dance\u00a0Gangnam Style).</p>\n<p>Old Spice got men here and there to smell good for some time, but men being men, got back to their good old habits of NOT smelling like an adventure, baking gourmet cakes with the kitchens they made with their own hands, \u00a0and definitely NOT swan diving.</p>\n<p>Old Spice needed to come up with something more epic for the manly men, not just for the women&#8217;s men, and so they again put together the smart minds of <a title=\"WK Portland\" href=\"http://www.wk.com/people/from/portland\" target=\"_blank\">Wieden+Kennedy Portland</a>\u00a0to figure out something that would spread like wildfire again.</p>\n<p>The WK folks thought&#8230;.so what do men like? They like basketball, they like to be the hero and save the world, they like random humor&#8230;.and, they like video games.</p>\n<p>Mix Basketball, a World-saving Hero, Random Humor, and Video Games together, and what comes out of the blender is their newest masterpiece:\u00a0DIKEMBE MUTOMBO&#8217;S 4 1/2 WEEKS TO SAVE THE WORLD\u00a0(yes, it has to be all caps).</p>\n<h3>Marketing Gamification through a game to save the world</h3>\n<p>DIKEMBE MUTOMBO&#8217;S 4 1/2 WEEKS TO SAVE THE WORLD is a 8-Bit styled game where users control the Basketball Legend\u00a0<a title=\"Dikimbe\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/25/sports/pro-basketball-mutombo-works-to-build-legacy-off-court.html?src=pm\" target=\"_blank\">Dikimbe Mutombo</a>\u00a0to prevent the <a title=\"2012\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon\" target=\"_blank\">2012 end of the world</a> (according to the Mayan&#8217;s calendar) from happening by accomplishing small quests that eventually leads to carving up more dates on the Mayan calendar so we can delay humanity&#8217;s extinction. At least until the day we invent self-combing hair.</p>\n<p>Actually, I&#8217;m not sure how the small quests have anything to do with carving the Mayan calendar, but those quests are always relevant to the times: from getting people to stop dancing Gangnam Style so they can vote (with the boss fight being the State of Ohio), to getting rid of a fluffy toy called Blurgies while playing\u00a0<em>It&#8217;s Thanksgiving</em>\u00a0by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSBq8geuJk0\" target=\"_blank\">Nicole Westbrook</a>, a successor of Rebecca Black).</p>\n<p>Of course, we don&#8217;t know what will happen next because each stage only unlocks one week at a time (explained later).</p>\n<h3>Running Octalysis on\u00a0DIKEMBE MUTOMBO&#8217;S 4 1/2 WEEKS TO SAVE THE WORLD</h3>\n<p>Below is the analysis of the campaign through my <a title=\"Octalysis: Complete Gamification Framework\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-research/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\">Complete Gamification Framework called Octalysis</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dikembe-Mutombo-Gamification-Old-Spice.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2454\" title=\"Dikembe Mutombo Gamification Old Spice\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dikembe-Mutombo-Gamification-Old-Spice.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dikimbe Mutombo Gamification from Old Spice\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dikembe-Mutombo-Gamification-Old-Spice.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dikembe-Mutombo-Gamification-Old-Spice.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As you can see, DM4.5WTSTW (this is my new abbreviation) has a strange rocket shape, as it scores incredibly high in Epic Meaning &amp; Calling, Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity, and Scarcity &amp; Impatience, but very low on most others. Because of that, it earns itself an Octalysis score of 260 (which is almost as high as Twitter!)<!--more--></p>\n<p>Lets look at how they appeal to the 8 Core Drives:</p>\n<h3>1) Epic Meaning &amp; Calling</h3>\n<p>This is what\u00a0DM4.5WTSTW did really, really well. It explains to the user WHY he (or she) should play the game. It&#8217;s not for the user&#8217;s enjoyment, nor for saving some virtual game world. It&#8217;s for saving the real world everyone lives in.</p>\n<p>By adding the game mechanic Narrative (#10) and Humanity Hero (#27), players are now on the journey to save mankind as a basketball star.</p>\n<p>Of course, no one REALLY believes that they can save the world this way, but the Narrative is just strong enough for people to think, &#8220;Oh okay. Just for laughs, let&#8217;s see what I need to do to &#8216;save the world.'&#8221; This gets them through the Discovery and the Onboarding Phase of a Game till the point where you hit stage 1 and realize your job is to get people to vote.</p>\n<p>At this point, the player thinks, &#8220;Oh yea. Voting is pretty important. My favorite candidate just won/lost the election, so its definitely important that EVERYONE votes.&#8221; And with this mindset, you get yourself all the way through to the Scaffolding phase of the game.</p>\n<h3>2) Development &amp; Accomplishment</h3>\n<p>DM4.5WTSTW isn&#8217;t very strong here, which is surprising as most gamification campaigns focus on this the most (Note: the GAME itself is not gamified, but the marketing campaign is). It vaguely keeps score of your performance, but besides winning and dying, there is not a lot of emphasis on how well you are progressing besides win-state count and stage progression.</p>\n<p>Towards the end, it hints at a leaderboard by having you type in your initials, but then afterwards, when you expect to see how well you have done against others (ideally your Facebook friends, but that&#8217;s perhaps asking too much), it ignores the entire thing and jumps into world-changing graphics. If there&#8217;s no braggable record, there&#8217;s nothing to share.</p>\n<h3>3) Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback</h3>\n<p>DM4.5WTSTW scores decently here, mostly because games themselves have an instant advantage of giving users Real-time Control (#41) of a character in any the user wants to accomplish his/her goals.</p>\n<p>Of course, this game itself doesn&#8217;t require a lot of skill, but it provides Instant Feedback (#12) to how well the player is doing. It also integrates a bit of the game technique Plant Picker\u00a0(#11) where users are given the WHAT they need to do and meaningful choices to do it.</p>\n<h3>4) Ownership &amp; Possession</h3>\n<p>This is something\u00a0DM4.5WTSTW does very poorly on. In no part of the game does the player feel like he has ownership over anything. There is no account so the game doesn&#8217;t remember anything, nothing happens after you enter you initials, and there&#8217;s nothing you can really customize.</p>\n<p>The only thing that provides a hint of ownership is simply a tiny Learning Curve (#6), where players feel like they are acquiring some skills to play the game better. Of course, that&#8217;s not too valuable to anyone beyond the 5 minutes of playing.</p>\n<h3>5) Social Pressure</h3>\n<p>DM4.5WTSTW also scores very poorly for this Core Drive, which is counterintuitive based on their objectives. The only thing that vaguely resembles some social element, is the ability to share the link on Twitter, Facebook, or embed the game on your blog like I did below. WK did not focus on WHY people would provide social pressure to their friends to play the game too besides novelty (which is summed up in Core Drive 7)</p>\n<h3>6) Scarcity &amp; Impatience</h3>\n<p>Now DM4.5WTSTW does very well on this\u00a0Black Hat Gamification technique, and it mainly does that through Options Pacing (#37) where it prevents people from playing more stages until the weekly countdown is up.</p>\n<p>When you complete a stage, the next thing you want to do is to complete the next stage. By preventing you from playing the second stage, DM4.5WTSTW forces you to think about it all week with a &#8220;yet to do&#8221; item on your mind. Scarcity feeds on people&#8217;s Impatience, causing them to check back irrationally even when they know the allotted time hasn&#8217;t passed yet (and of course, this impatience is what causes people to buy virtual goods with real money).</p>\n<p>WK may have done this for other practical reasons too, including developing the game as the weeks go by, and making sure its incorporating the latest fad to keep things interesting. Nevertheless, this was very well played.</p>\n<h3>7) Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity</h3>\n<p>This is where WK consistently demonstrates the most mastery in. During the Discovery and Onboarding Phase of DM4.5WTSTW, people play the game due to Epic Meeting &amp; Calling, but as players enter the Scaffolding Phase,\u00a0Unpredictability\u00a0&amp; Curiosity takes over in the form of funny and random conversations as well as Mischief (#51).</p>\n<p>Players are always wondering, &#8220;What&#8217;s going to happen next? Is he going to say something funny? Is he going to eat the turkey? Is the boss going to be Rebecca Black??&#8221; and that makes them want to continue on playing to see the next stage, as well as the Win-State Animations.</p>\n<h3>8) Loss &amp; Avoidance</h3>\n<p>Similar to Ownership and Possession, DM4.5WTSTW doesn&#8217;t do too much here as there are no actions users take to avoid a loss. The only mechanics (not counting &#8220;the end of the world&#8221;) that people focus on is death prevention, which mostly results in Progress Loss (#81), where users loses the 2 minutes they spent getting all the way up to the boss. Not too big of a driving factor.</p>\n<h3>Actionable Improvements based on Octalysis</h3>\n<p>As you can see from the brief analysis above, there are a TON of things that could make\u00a0DM4.5WTSTW more engaging, viral, and addicting.</p>\n<p>A quick list is below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Show a leaderboard that allows players to share and compare with their friends</li>\n<li>Have a better Onboarding Process with a pop-up that shows the control keys for each game (so people don&#8217;t just get stuck on moving and clicking the finger for 8 seconds)</li>\n<li>Allow the user to have a little bit more customization so they feel ownership of the game (even just a shirt color change, or even unique hairstyles makes it more interesting.)</li>\n<li>Consider a 2P mode (or #22 Group Quest) where a person can invite a friend to play Science the Bear and complete a mission together. Perhaps there is a bonus stage where in order to see the final animation, you need to get a friend to play a fighting game against you (Dikembe vs Science the Bear perhaps) and only the winner of this fight will see the end animation with funny dialogues.</li>\n<li>On a similar theme, create Easter Eggs (#30) that users can discover (hidden features or dialogues) and tell others about.</li>\n<li>Create a better Visual Grave (#38) and Weep Tune (#39) experience when the user dies, perhaps have Dikembe say a few funny lines like, &#8220;OO NOO! Dikembe can no longer save the world any longer finger because player is making too many finger mistakes&#8230;&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<div>Perhaps we may see a few of these implemented by WK as the weeks go by.</div>\n<div></div>\n<h3>The Game</h3>\n<p>The embeddable game has been taken off, but here is the link to the Game: http://kbhgames.com/8790/old-spice-%7C-dikembe-mutombos-4-1-2-weeks-to-save-the-world/</p>\n",

But I made a few changes based on my experience as a gamer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>The first experience phase of a game is Discovery</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This is when people first discover your product or service.</li>\n<li>How did they find it? Was it from a friend? Through the news? Or a clever marketing campaign that you devised?</li>\n<li>\u00a0Gamifying the discovery phase is a great way to improve your brand name, sign ups, and conversions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Phase 2 of a Gamer&#8217;s experience is Onboarding</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This is when you train them to become familiar with the rules of the game, options, mechanics, and the win state.</li>\n<li>This is what most people focus on because everyone thinks once a customer uses their product for sometime, they would all fall in love with it.</li>\n<li>Mastering the Onboarding Process can get your users to start participate in your game with excitement and interest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The 3rd experience phase of a game is Scaffolding.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaffolding is a term that Professor Werbach uses to describe the third phase.</li>\n<li>I tend to like the term &#8220;mid game&#8221; better, mostly from my chess background</li>\n<li>(i also used to be a chess coach)</li>\n<li>But I think I will comply to authority and use his term.</li>\n<li>It sounds fancier too&#8230;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Now is the time for Scaffolding!&#8221;</li>\n<li>Anyhow, scaffolding is the phase where players use all the rules and options they learned during onboarding to try to achieve the win-state as many times as possible.</li>\n<li>This is supposedly where the most &#8220;fun&#8221; should happen.</li>\n<li>\u00a0Once you have a well designed win state in scaffolding that appeals to the 8 Core Drives of Octalysis,</li>\n<li>\u00a0you will start to see player engagement and motivation</li>\n<li>\u00a0Which of course, helps you with you business metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\u00a0The fourth and FINAL experience phase of a game is the Endgame</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This is when players have done everything there is to do at least once and are starting to see more repetitive actions to get to the win-state.</li>\n<li>In this phase, if the designer didn&#8217;t create a good endgame, people easily get bored and quit the game.</li>\n<li>But a good endgame can be achieved through evergreen mechanics as well as creating a system where the game producers can easily add new content in a system consistently.</li>\n<li>if you mastered the endgame, you will create a lot of contributors, evangelists, and longterm customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This concludes this episode. Next episode we will talk about how to combine everything we have learned up to this point and apply Octalysis to the 4 Experience Phases.</p>\n<p>After that, you will become a Level One Octalysis Gamifier.</p>\n",

It was a good game to play for me and my bio.</h4>\n<h3>Gamifying the competition between Gamification Gurus</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s been 2 months since I heavily focused my blog on Gamification (although I started working in Gamification since 2003&#8230;it just wasn&#8217;t called that back then).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve published my <a title=\"Octalysis: Complete Gamification Framework\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-research/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/\" target=\"_blank\">Gamification Framework called Octalysis</a>, which was a massively successful and was received very well with companies and professors wanting me to demonstrate more on how to use this framework to make good business (and personal) decisions.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also finished 3 Episodes (out of 90) of the Video Series: <a title=\"New Video Series: The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Gamification (1 of 90)\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/beginners-guide-to-gamification/video-series-beginners-guide-gamification-1-90/\" target=\"_blank\">The Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Gamification</a>, which is a video education program that combines learning with fun (an actually gamified video course).</p>\n<p>This is more of a slow but persistent play, where it probably won&#8217;t take off like crazy at the very beginning, but once I finish all 90 episodes, there will be nothing like that on the internet. (Episode 4 coming out in a few days) Also, I&#8217;ve already been approached by many parties regarding how they could use Gamification for their organization, after viewing my goofy but hopefully educational videos.</p>\n<p>But even with that, it came as a complete surprise to me when I saw myself making the <a title=\"Gamification Leaderboard\" href=\"http://gamificationofwork.com/2012/11/gamification-gurus-november-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">Top 40 List of Gamification Gurus</a>.</p>\n<p><!--more-->I&#8217;ve considered myself as the underdog who has a lot of knowledge and experience in Gamification, but one who has been focusing on tech startups and not building my brand in Gamification. My goal was to get more of an established recognition after a year of persistently sharing my knowledge on my blog, while trying to make my startup company successful (that&#8217;s why I can only film my footages when I&#8217;m walking in-between meetings!)</p>\n<p>So making this list was a true honor and I feel very flattered.</p>\n<p>And of course, now that I see a Leaderboard on Gamification Gurus, the game is on! Now I MUST be the Guru-est Guru of all Gamification Gurus!!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

The idea is simple: you set your alarm on Gun O&#8217;Clock the night before, and at the designated time in the morning, on top of the usual PiPiPiPi sound (or any custom sound that you can record), a bull-eye target will come up and the &#8220;user&#8221; will need to grab a gun and shoot at the target 5 times in order to get it to quiet down.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a video of how it works (&#8220;Iz Coool!&#8221;):</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/5rNiYQ2CnhU\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Gun O&#8217;Clock: 1<br />\nBed: 0</p>\n<p>&#8220;Iz Coool!&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Tackling the &#8220;Waking Up&#8221; Industry with Gamification</h3>\n<p>The &#8220;Waking Up&#8221; Industry, or&#8230;Alarm Clocks, has been in a constant battle in finding out the best way to get people out of bed happily and vigorously.</p>\n<p><!--more-->There are &#8220;intelligent&#8221; products like the <a title=\"Y Combinator\" href=\"http://tech.co/launch-pad-book-y-combinator-2012-09\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YCombinator</a> Startup WakeMate (which is no longer operation&#8230;<a title=\"Wakemate\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/running-on-empty-wakemate-finds-out-what-happens-when-partners-break-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with an interesting story</a>) and the Zeo&nbsp;(which I personally use and love &#8211; highly recommended) that measures your sleeping patterns, detects <a title=\"REM Sleep\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">REM</a>/Quality sleep, and wakes you up when you finished your full cycle (sometimes sleeping 8 minutes more would get you to become more tired as it interrupts you in the middle of a quality sleep cycle).</p>\n<p>There are &#8220;stealth wake&#8221; products like the Lark, which is designed to wake up one person quietly, without interrupting his/her partner. This is great for people on <a title=\"Poliphasic Sleep\" href=\"http://www.ultracrepidate.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Polyphasic Sleep Schedules</a>.</p>\n<p>Then there are &#8220;Gamification&#8221; products that make you play a little game in order to wake up. Another example is&nbsp;Clocky, which is an alarm clock on wheels and you need to catch the little pest before you can turn it off. There&#8217;s even a Helicopter Alarm Clock&nbsp;that shoots out a propellor in the air and you need to find it and put it back into the clock to turn it off.</p>\n<p>Of course, none of that feels as epic as grabbing a gun and shooting your alarm clock with a shotgun noise until it tells you that you are excellent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Iz Coool!&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Any other Gamification concepts that wake you up in the morning?

What was the motivation behind creating\u00a0Zamzee?</span></h3>\n</div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The purpose of\u00a0Zamzee\u00a0is to make moving fun so that more kids enjoy being active. Today over 1/3 of Americans are overweight and/or obese. Research and real life, practical experience tells us that physical activity declines around ages 9 to 15, right when kids are forming lifelong habits. That&#8217;s why\u00a0Zamzee\u00a0is targeting this age-group with a product designed for kids (with their help, too!) that makes physical activity more fun.\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">HopeLab Foundation (with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation) recently completed a 6 month scientific research study on\u00a0Zamzee, showing thatZamzee\u00a0increases physical activity by almost 60% and reduces key biological risk factors for diseases associated with obesity.

We use rewards to bring kids into the fold of\u00a0Zamzee, to capture their attention and make them excited about using\u00a0Zamzee. This is great to &#8220;get the kids off the couch,&#8221; so to speak. Once kids start using\u00a0Zamzee, we make sure that rewards don&#8217;t become the sole focus of the\u00a0Zamzee\u00a0experience by emphasizing gamification and fun. Lots of fun! This fosters kids&#8217; intrinsic motivation to be more active, so that physical activity becomes a habit instead of a chore.\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Our approach is deeply grounded in academic research on motivation and a long research and iterative process developing the\u00a0Zamzee\u00a0product itself.</span></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Zamzee-Gamification-2.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2357\" style=\"border: 2px solid black;\" title=\"Zamzee Gamification Quest\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Zamzee-Gamification-2.png?resize=600%2C283&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Zamzee Gamification Quest\" width=\"600\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Zamzee-Gamification-2.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Zamzee-Gamification-2.png?resize=300%2C142&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">4. Why does using a website make kids want to move around more in real life?</span></h3>\n</div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Kids these days are used to being plugged in and online. We meet kids where they already are \u2013 at their computers \u2013 and incorporate components of online gaming \u2013 like rewards, badges, levels, etc \u2013 with which they are familiar and enjoy. But we do not make the website the sole focus of the product experience. Every component of the website, from your activity graph, to challenges, to rewards is driven by your offline actions (Eg, how much you move around). In order to unlock the good stuff, like passing levels on the website, earning rewards, or taking Challenges, kids need to unplug from their computer and move.</span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Zamzee-Screenshot.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2359\" style=\"border: 2px solid black;\" title=\"Zamzee Quest Example\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Zamzee-Screenshot.png?resize=600%2C430&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Zamzee Quest Example\" width=\"600\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Zamzee-Screenshot.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Zamzee-Screenshot.png?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0</span></div>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">5.

This will allow Zamzee to be a lot more social and fun. Zamzee could even introduce\u00a0<strong>Mentorship</strong>, where if a person runs around with someone that is much higher leveled, they would level up faster too.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Collection Sets:</strong> Zamzee could create rewards in collection sets. If kids redeemed their points for one reward in a collection set, they would automatically want to complete the set (by running more, of course).</p>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a lot more Zamzee could be doing to add more game mechanics into their product to make it more fun and engaging. But so far they have their exciting product road map that they told me is topic SECRET, and that they would have to kill me if they told me. I guess I prefer to live and see it happen \ud83d\ude42</p>\n",

Many of you asked, &#8220;But how do we do Marketing Gamification? What does that even mean?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Well, Toyota is here to show you with its all new Plug-In Champion App!</p>\n<h3>Toyota Plug-in Championship shows you who&#8217;s the best at charging your phones</h3>\n<p>The <a title=\"Toyota Plugin\" href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/429473/consumers-voting-for-plug-in-hybrids-over-evs/\" target=\"_blank\">Toyota Plug-in</a>\u00a0is a new hybrid car they are pushing out, and they&#8217;re looking for ways to make their car stand out.</p>\n<p>What they&#8217;ve come up with is sad and brilliant at the same time &#8211; they made an iPhone app that turns charging your phone into a game.</p>\n<p>Introducing the Plug-In Championship, where people compete in charging their phones at just the right second!</p>\n<h3>This is how it works:</h3>\n<p>You open the app, and it shows some slick Tron-like designs with a meter bar that goes up and down. You need to plug the charger into your phone at just the right moment where the meter bar is full (or as full as you can accurately do).</p>\n<p>Once you plug in the charger into your phone (lol, I feel so pathetic writing about this), an epic graphic will load, such as a lightning bolt striking, a rocket taking off, or a corkscrew gets popped. <strong>Woohoo!! I just charged my phone with electric power!!</strong></p>\n<p>It then shows you a leaderboard of all the people charging their phones at the &#8220;right time&#8221;&#8230;.as well as &#8220;medals&#8221; that I have not earned yet.</p>\n<p>To make things even more strangely epic, if you go to their\u00a0Plug-In Championship\u00a0website and click on &#8220;Ranking&#8221; it will show you a global view of all the people who are charging their phones with the app on, with very fancy lightning bolt animations, as if we are fulfilling a calling like <a title=\"Captain Planet and Planeteers\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Planet_and_the_Planeteers\" target=\"_blank\">Captain Planet and the Planeteers</a>\u00a0to save the earth. This is also similar to what Smule did with their <a title=\"Ocarina\" href=\"http://blog.smule.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ocarina App</a>, except they actually did have something exciting to tout to the world (a new song you are playing).</p>\n<h3>So was this Marketing Gamification Technique Effective?</h3>\n<p>Lets just say this: not only did this silly app get viewed on Youtube over 15,000 times in 2 weeks, it led to people like me mentioning about the Toyota brand and telling you about their new Toyota Plug-in (I&#8217;ve never talked about a car brand before on my blog!). If this campaign caused at least ONE extra person to buy the car now or later, I would say its pretty effective.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

If you are a low budget company looking to get tons of traffic in one month, you can&#8217;t make online video shows everyday like <a href=\"http://winelibrary.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> did because even the great Garyvee took two years to make it big. If you hire a \u201csocial media expert\u201d to run a blog and Twitter account for you, you will quickly lose faith in social media because they&#8217;re not going to get you 100K visitors in a month by just doing that.</p>\n<h3>Different companies with different goals should have different social media marketing techniques</h3>\n<p>This is a serious pain in the industry because social media marketing is something that truly works and can be very powerful, but most people(companies and consultants alike) have a lot of misconceptions regarding the different strategies and how they should be used.</p>\n<p>In this post, I attempt to break social media marketing down into 5 Main Techniques. In that way, if you are a company, you can ask your social media experts to do a Social Media Targeting Campaign, instead of just a vague Social Media Marketing Campaign. If you are a consultant, make sure your client knows what you are doing for them and what results they can expect.</p>\n<h3>Social Media Marketing Technique 1: SM <span class=\"zem_slink\">Brand Management</span></h3>\n<p>This is the most common technique that the \u201cexperts\u201d promise to do. This includes creating and maintaining a blog and Twitter Account, engage people who are interested, share valuable things in your industry, and eventually build up followers, visitors, and trust. It might even involve maintaining a Facebook Fanpage (not effective if you DO NOT already have a strong brand established) or a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"LinkedIn\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com\" rel=\"homepage\">LinkedIn</a> group.</p>\n<p>This technique is effective because it fully utilizes the SOCIAL part of social media. You are out there engaging your target audience. You are making friends with them and creating value for them. You are building your own popularity and trust. If someone knows what you do and thinks positively of you, when they need your product or services, they will not go on Google and find a random service they don&#8217;t know. They will buy it from you. If their friends are looking for services you offer, they will refer their friends to you.</p>\n<p>The problem with Social Media Brand Management is that it takes time, patience and persistence. Since you are not out there to close deals but to build trust, you won&#8217;t see an immediate increase in sales or signups. It&#8217;s only when people really trust you and care about you do they start to check out your stuff, and that could take months to years to build.</p>\n<p>Companies who consistently pressure their Social Brand Building workers to self-promote, get traffic, and get sales will hurt themselves in the longrun and fail in social media marketing. They clearly do not understand that this technique was not appropriate for their 1 month ROI agendas.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Pros</strong></span><br />\nReally engages your target market. Builds trusts. Leads to sustainable success.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Cons<br />\n</strong></span>Extremely slow. Takes a lot of time. Need to truly care about your audience.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>When to use Social Brand Building<br />\n</strong></span>When you have a longterm vision of your brand and social influence on the internet, and you can dedicate at least one longterm person who understands what it takes to be popular online and engage with your target audience.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>End Result:</strong></span> Brand</p>\n<h3>Social Media Marketing Technique 2: SM Targeting</h3>\n<p><!--more-->Social Media Targeting is where you find individuals on social media platforms one by one and engage them about your services. This includes finding and tweeting people on Twitter based on their description or keyword tweets, contacting someone directly on LinkedIn for a B2B sale, or commenting on a blogger&#8217;s post.</p>\n<p>Social Media Targeting is probably the most direct way of social media marketing. In one sense, it is like sales. If someone tweets out \u201cI need a plumber in vancouver&#8230;\u201d you immediately tweet them with \u201cWe&#8217;re in Vancouver and would love to help you out!\u201d If someone complains about your competitor, you tweet them about yourself. Twitter is usually the best tool for Social Media Targeting for B2C businesses. If you sell corporate solutions, you would utilize LinkedIn to locate the decision makers and approach them. This can yield short-term and effective results, depending on how much time you put into it.</p>\n<p><strong>The problem with Social Media Targeting is that, if not done carefully, it could be be seen as spam.</strong> If you contact 200 people in a day, and you are NOT being a hero to them by providing them exactly what they need, they will view you as a spammer. Yes, the spamming industry makes a lot of money, but once you are identified as a spammer, it would completely destroy the long efforts you have put in for Social Media Brand Management and ruin your reputation.</p>\n<p>On top of that, your accounts might be flagged or get deleted. That&#8217;s why make sure your Social Media Targeting operator really understands how to provide what people are looking for, not overload them with irrelevant services.</p>\n<p>Another problem to Social Media Targeting is that it is not as scalable. By nature of this technique you are contacting one person at a time. Even though the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Conversion rate\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate\" rel=\"wikipedia\">conversion rate</a> and ROI is high for this, it is difficult to execute it on a massive scale without many dedicated employees just doing this.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Pros<br />\n</span></strong>Very direct. Immediate results. Measurable ROI.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Cons<br />\n</strong></span>Risk of being spam. Could hurt reputation. Difficult to scale.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>When to use Social Media Targeting<br />\n</strong></span>When you are looking for short-term results while not being too concerned with longterm branding. You also need a dedicated person who understands social media etiquette in order to not become spammy.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>End Result</strong></span>: Sales/Conversions</p>\n<h3>Social Media Marketing Technique 3: Marketing Gamification</h3>\n<p>Marketing Gamification is when you create your own viral content that usually indirectly promotes your brand or services. This includes creating a viral video, hosting a competition, or creating a novel site that&#8217;s just to get peoples&#8217; attention. Some examples of those, respectably, are the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ3d3KigPQM\" rel=\"nofollow\">T-Mobile Plaza Dance</a>, <a title=\"Marketing Gamification: Old Spice launches the Game DIKEMBE MUTOMBO\u2019S 4 1/2 WEEKS TO SAVE THE WORLD\" href=\"http://www.yukaichou.com/marketing-gamification/marketing-gamification-oldspice-launches-game-dikembe-mutombos-4-12-weeks-save-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Dikembe Mutombo&#8217;s 4 1/2 Weeks to Save the World</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comparethemeerkat.com/\">Compare The Meerkat</a>.</p>\n<p>The difficult thing about Marketing Gamification is that it is usually a bigger-scaled campaign (hence more expensive), and the odds of it really turning viral are extremely low. Very few \u201csocial media consultants\u201d offer this service (most blogposts lie in the Social Brand Building realm), as it usually takes an organized professional firm to coordinate the entire thing. This also usually needs to be accompanied with the rest of the social media techniques to create the full effect.</p>\n<p>With Marketing Gamification, if it truly becomes viral, you are able to reach millions of people. However, when people talk about it, they usually don&#8217;t talk about the brands but the campaign itself, so make sure the campaign connects to the company itself in one way or another.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Pros<br />\n</strong></span>Potential of reaching millions of people. Opens the door to the 2 other social media marketing techniques below. Creates more buzz that other techniques.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Cons<br />\n</strong></span>Larger-scaled. More expensive. Chances of being viral is slim.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>When to use Viral Content Production<br />\n</strong></span>When your company has a deeper pocket and wants to create unique buzz in your industry. It&#8217;s also more appropriate for products and services that aren&#8217;t interesting/sexy by themselves.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>End Result: Buzz</strong></span></p>\n<h3>Social Media Marketing Technique 4: Social Bookmarking Promotion</h3>\n<p>Social Bookmarking Sites are services where people share resources via a reference URL instead of the content itself. These sites include Digg, StumbleUpon, Mixx, Delicious and dozens more. The goal for this technique is to get on the front page or get top ranked on these sites, driving tons and tons of traffic to your website.</p>\n<p>In order for this to work, two things need to happen. One is that you have content or services that could go viral (so this technique follows the last one). Two is that you need to be able to get the power users of the bookmarking sites to endorse you. This could be a tricky thing to do and will often cost you money.</p>\n<p>When you make a hit with social bookmarking sites, the traffic you can get is so high that it sometimes crashes your server (traffic from Digg that crashes your site is called the \u201cDigg Effect\u201d). However, a lot of the times the traffic itself is not very targeted (especially from StumbleUpon), so conversion rates are usually really low since no one is looking to buy anything.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Pros<br />\n</span></strong>Can drive tons and tons of traffic in a very short amount of time.<br />\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cons<br />\n</span></strong>Slightly difficult to execute. Very untargeted traffic. Low conversion rates and time on site. Usually need to pay even if not successful.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>When to use Social Bookmarking Generation</strong></span><br />\nWhen you have viral content or services, have some cash to adventure with, and need to drive a lot of traffic in a short time.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>End Result:</strong></span> Traffic</p>\n<h3>Social Media Marketing Technique 5: SM Influencer Campaign</h3>\n<p>This is pretty much having influencers who are popular bloggers, tweeters, video makers and such promote your product/services for you. This is probably the most effective and powerful ways of doing social media marketing. The biggest problem with Social Media Brand Management is that it takes too much time to build that trust with the online audience, ranging from months to years. In an Influencer Campaign, you are leveraging the engagement and trust others have built for months and years. This creates the strongest form of traffic because not only can it create hundreds of thousands of visitor, it also has a very high brand building and conversation rate since it is through a trusted referral.</p>\n<p>To make this happen, marketers need to identify who are the top influencers in their niches and establish relationships with them. Some marketers pay the influencers directly to advertise or sponsor a conversation, some give out free units, and some just give out first dibs to new services. Whatever it is, make sure the blogger discloses the relationship to their readers to not get in trouble. Getting through this is a huge pain, but once it is executed well, it is the most effective form of social media marketing for making something go viral (think Tim Ferriss&#8217; Four Hour Work Week).</p>\n<p>Finally, your product or service must be viral or sexy for this to work well since bloggers are putting their reputation on the line and are not going to promote random commodities. If your product/service itself is not special, then be sure to create a unique and outrageous campaign that you want these influencers to write about.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Pros<br />\n</strong></span>Generates large amount of qualified traffic through a medium of trust. Builds a strong brand. Fast results.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Cons</strong><br />\n</span>Expensive or Time Consuming. Risk of influencers refusing to help or write negative posts about your service/product.<br />\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">When do use Social Media Influencer Campaign</span><br />\n</strong>When your company has a budget, a sexy product or is launching a unique campaign/competition and need lots of buzz with targetted traffic onto your site.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>End Result</strong></span>: Brand + Traffic + Sales/Conversions</p>\n<h3>What techniques have you tried and what works best?</h3>\n<p>Out of these strategies, what have you tried in the past and what works for you? What doesn&#8217;t work for you? Are there any more techniques that you can think of? It&#8217;s time to leave a message in the comment section.</p>\n",

Yelp is bad for [the] business community and any effort to support them will [continue to affect businesses negatively]. They are first of all not business friendly and most of the Yelpers are bargain hunters. 90% of the reviews are complaints and it has become a complaint forum.</p>\n<p>Why do you want business to pay / support a complaint forum. If people really care about business they can talk with the owners and resolve issues. You dont want people to give you a 1 star because they dont like the paint color or they didnt like the owners hair style.</p>\n<p>I strongly suggest you should do research and write about how Yelp can hurt local community. Yelp makes a business by pitting customers against business. This is not a healthy model for the economy and local community.</p>\n<p>The only way for Yelp to fail is to ignore them and stop their cash flow from businesses. If businesses understand this they will stop support to Yelp.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With so much compelling evidence, should business owners completely shun away Yelp?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>Ignoring the problem won&#8217;t make it go away</h3>\n<p>The number one mistake that a business can make is to ignore Yelp. \u00a0Yelp is a public company that isn&#8217;t going away any time soon. \u00a0Whether a business owner likes it or not, consumers use Yelp on a daily basis to discover new restaurants and other types of local businesses. \u00a0Just this week I used Yelp to find a Smog Check service and a Hair Cut Salon for men.</p>\n<h3>Why do customers give out more negative reviews than positive reviews?</h3>\n<p>Give a customer a good experience and he&#8217;ll go home happy.</p>\n<p>Give a customer a bad experience and he&#8217;ll tell 5 of his friends about how terrible the business is.</p>\n<p>This is just human nature, and is reflected in the distribution of positive vs negative Yelp reviews. \u00a0The critical factor to take note of is that a Yelp user will write a negative review on Yelp even if you choose to ignore Yelp. \u00a0All of Yelp&#8217;s users will see this negative review and your business will be hurt because of it.</p>\n<p>This is why it&#8217;s so important to take ownership of Yelp and use it as a way to salvage a relationship with a distraught customer. \u00a0Don&#8217;t ignore Yelp; take advantage of it to communicate directly with\u00a0dissatisfied\u00a0customers and fix the problem.</p>\n<h3>Yelp can be a huge positive for a business</h3>\n<p>A study by the Harvard Business School determined that a restaurant that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/03/yelp-review-revenue_n_992096.html\" target=\"_blank\">boosts its Yelp score by one full star </a>can see revenue increases from 5 &#8211; 9 percent! \u00a0This is huge!!!</p>\n<p>The goal of a local business is of course to serve great food and provide excellent service. \u00a0Great food and excellent service will naturally drive positive reviews on Yelp, but there are strategies that you can utilize to drive Yelp users to positively review your restaurant on Yelp.</p>\n<h3>Do not invest in Yelp Ads</h3>\n<p>Though we advocate strategies to get customers to positively review a local business on Yelp, we are highly against ads for Yelp. \u00a0There are plenty of <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/14/yelp-ads-leave-bad-impressions-for-small-businesses/\" target=\"_blank\">posts</a> written about how Yelp ads do NOT target the right keywords and are NOT relevant to the user&#8217;s search terms.</p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.</p>\n<p>In this case, stay as close as possible to Yelp because it has a big impact on your local business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

While you wait, you can always explore others pins \ud83d\ude42<!--more--></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1363 aligncenter\" title=\"Pinterst Confirmation\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Pinterst-Confirmation.png?resize=498%2C173&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"173\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>2. Create your account</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1367 aligncenter\" title=\"Pinterest Invite\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Pinterest-Invite.png?resize=498%2C141&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"141\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Once you get your invite, you will need to choose by which social account your Pinterest account will be connected too. Currently the two options you can choose from our Twitter and Facebook. If you do not have either, you <strong>cannot</strong> sign-up for an account.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1366 aligncenter\" title=\"Pinterest Create Account\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Pinterest-Create-Account.png?resize=499%2C248&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"248\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>After you select the social account which you want to connect with, you are able to create your account including selecting a username. If you are a business, use your business name for your username.</p>\n<p>Whole Foods Market Pinterest page:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1368 aligncenter\" title=\"Whole Foods Pinterest\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Whole-Foods-Pinterest.png?resize=498%2C187&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"187\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>3. Get Pinning!</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve created your Pinterest account, the next step is to start building your &#8216;brand.&#8217;</p>\n<p>For a business, Pinterest is great because once something is &#8216;pinned,&#8217; it will link back directly to the original posting.</p>\n<p>When building out your wall, don&#8217;t just focus on pinning your own products. Pin other products that are relevant to your brand and industry. For example, if you are an Italian restaurant, pin not only your food, but also recipes, places in Italy and also things that inspire your dishes.</p>\n<h3><strong>\u00a04. Share and Interact</strong></h3>\n<p>Remember how you linked your Facebook or Twitter account when you first setup your Pinterest? Share your Pinterest wall with your friends and community on your social networks to build up a following.</p>\n<p>Similar to how you interact on Facebook and Twitter, comment, share, and Like others Pins to gain traction and grow your engagement.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Track Pinterest ROI/Success</strong></h3>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve had a chance to setup your page and shared it, the next step is to begin measuring success. By success, we refer to if it can make a positive impact on your business. From sales to branding opportunities, every business will have different milestones.</p>\n<p>One easy and simple way that every business can take advantage of is to use Google Analytics or another data analytics program such as Omniture, to track traffic that comes to your website via Pinterest. To learn more about setting up tracking, check out this <a title=\"Google Analytics Setup\" href=\"http://www.flyteblog.com/flyte/2008/12/setting-up-google-analytics-a-stepbystep-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide on setting it up Google Analytics</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>Are you currently using Pinterest for your business?

Twitter can get time consuming</strong>: a Twitter client can help you stay productive and effective without making you commit more time than needed on Twitter</p>\n<p><strong>2. To space out (schedule) Tweets</strong>: it&#8217;s more effective to space out Tweets throughout the day (1 Tweet every 4 hours) rather than clump Tweets all at once (5 Tweets within 30 minutes)</p>\n<p><strong>3. Track data of Tweets and reach</strong>: easily view your Tweets and track clicks to determine your most effective Tweets</p>\n<h3>Why use Buffer and how it works</h3>\n<p>One word: <em><strong>simplicity</strong></em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve used the other clients such as HootSuite and TweetDeck and I found them to be way too time consuming and too feature-rich.</p>\n<h4>How Buffer works</h4>\n<p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/buffer-dashboard.png?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1334\" title=\"buffer-dashboard\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/buffer-dashboard.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The dashboard allows me to quickly view which Tweets are scheduled to go out and when. \u00a0As you can see from my dashboard, I have a scheduled Tweet going out today at 7pm.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t schedule Tweets via the dashboard &#8211; there are much more effective ways to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/buffer-analytics.png?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1335\" title=\"buffer-analytics\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/buffer-analytics.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The analytics page lets me easily see the data that is important to me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clicks that my links receive</li>\n<li>Potential reach</li>\n<li>Retweets</li>\n<li>Mentions</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Scheduling</strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1336\" title=\"buffer-schedule\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/buffer-schedule.png?resize=324%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"324\" height=\"381\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Buffer is great because it lets you customize the scheduling for Tweets. \u00a0I kept mine at the default setting as I like my scheduled Tweets (which are usually business and productivity related) to go out earlier in the day.</p>\n<h4>How I schedule Tweets</h4>\n<p><strong>1. Buffer for Chrome</strong></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1337\" title=\"buffer-chrome\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/buffer-chrome.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/buffer-chrome-2.png?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1338\" title=\"buffer-chrome-2\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/buffer-chrome-2.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Buffer for Chrome is a simple extension that allows you to easily schedule any webpage as a Tweet. \u00a0Above you&#8217;ll see where the icon is placed in the browser and how Buffer allows you to customize your Tweet before you schedule it.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Buffer on Twitter</strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1339\" title=\"buffer-on-twitter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/buffer-on-twitter.png?resize=322%2C268&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"322\" height=\"268\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Because Buffer is integrated with Twitter, I can directly use it through my Twitter dashboard.</p>\n<h3>Twitter strategies to stay consistent and effective</h3>\n<p>Here are the principles that I use to stay effective and consistent on Twitter:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Only follow people that are important and valuable to you</strong>: check out my twitter page and you&#8217;ll see that I follow only a select group of 197 individuals. \u00a0These 197 individuals constantly share valuable content and articles, saving me time because I don&#8217;t have to manually find valuable content to share.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t mass follow &#8211; it&#8217;s worthless and dumb. \u00a0Follow people that are important to you and you&#8217;ll be able to share better content with your audience.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Follow bloggers that always write quality content</strong>: I follow <a href=\"http://www.thrillingheroics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cody</a>, <a href=\"http://carlosmiceli.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Carlos</a>, <a href=\"http://www.carmensognonvi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Carmen</a>, <a href=\"http://manvsdebt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baker</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neil</a> on a consistent basis because they always write great content that is relevant to my audience. \u00a0It makes it easy to share Tweets about good articles my community will benefit from.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Relax</strong>: don&#8217;t worry if there&#8217;s nothing to Tweet about. \u00a0Take a deep breath and relax &#8211; it&#8217;s not the end of the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

From learning the basics of kicking to the different types of strokes, becoming an expert is not an overnight matter. On the other hand, not all of us learn how to swim through a set process. For some, learning to swim involved being dropped into a pool (or in some cases a large body of water) and &#8216;improvising.&#8217; Much like the latter, this is how many businesses learn how about social media.</p>\n<p>In what can be best described as a trial and error style marketing approach, businesses that jump into the &#8216;social media&#8217; pool, can find themselves looking for a life vest if they aren&#8217;t careful. To help businesses avoid making the same mistakes that others make, we&#8217;ve come up with <strong>4 Common Social Media Mistakes Businesses Make</strong>:<!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>1. Relying on Facebook Fans for Sales</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1320 aligncenter\" title=\"Gap Facebook\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Gap-Facebook.png?resize=500%2C295&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gap Facebook\" width=\"500\" height=\"295\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />If you are relying on Facebook Fans to drive your sales, then you should be worried. While Facebook is an excellent distribution channel for your brand, it should a business should not use it as a sole revenue generation tool. The truth of the matter is that while large and at times highly engaging, Facebook is still in its infancy in driving direct sales from the site.</p>\n<p>By no means should this lower the relevance or need to be on Facebook, but rather it should keep goals and expectations realistic in what to expect from being on the webs largest social network.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Playing the &#8220;waiting game&#8221;</strong></h3>\n<p>When the concept of &#8216;social media&#8217; was introduced, no one knew what to expect. To this day, there are those that are still unsure.</p>\n<p>For brands though, playing the waiting game is no longer a viable strategy. With everyday that passes, another competitor moves further in relevance through the digital space. What were once valid points on holding out from building out a presence on social media outlets, are now excuses. Businesses that don&#8217;t consider social media as one of their priorities in regards to marketing and business strategy\u00a0 are putting themselves at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Remember that after a certain point a reason can become an excuse. With the digital boom now entering it&#8217;s third year of growth, now is the time to join in if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. The Solution to All</strong></h3>\n<p>Social media is a powerful and valuable tool for businesses, but to call it the solution to all ones problems is overvaluing it. Everything has its limits, and social media is no exception to the rule.</p>\n<p>For example, expecting social media to bring your company out of bankruptcy is unrealistic.</p>\n<p>Just how you wouldn&#8217;t try to use a fork when eating cereal, social media has a place and use. Before starting, make sure you full understand the use and core foundation of the social media platform you are looking to use.</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Facebook Resource | Twitter Resource<br />\nPinterest Resource | Yelp Resource</h5>\n<h3><strong>4. Being a News Feed</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the most common mistakes that businesses do when starting out is to appear to be just a news feed of information associated with their brand.</p>\n<p>For example, check out the following Twitter news feed:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1315 aligncenter\" title=\"Twitter News Feed\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Twitter-News-Feed.png?resize=453%2C406&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Twitter News Feed\" width=\"453\" height=\"406\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>From a user&#8217;s point of view, the feed reads like a newspaper: one-sided with no opportunity for interaction. With that in mind, what reason does the user have to follow/interact with the brand/business?</p>\n<p>Remember that social media is all about the 2-way conversation and taking down the barriers that often separate brands and their fans.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip: Be creative, be innovative.</strong></p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>What other common mistakes have you seen businesses make when it comes to social media?

As a retailer, being in front of the consumer at every possible opportunity is key. In the case of social media, the opportunity is huge. With communities that reach into the high millions, retailers that take advantage of the numbers will be able to tap into the consumer that is listening and looking.<!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>2. Consumers are actively looking for product promotions</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1270 aligncenter\" title=\"Banana Republic Facebook\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Banana-Republic-Facebook.png?resize=499%2C306&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Banana Republic Facebook\" width=\"499\" height=\"306\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />So why does a consumer even follow a retailer online? One of the main reasons is for product promotions. From free samples to first-offers on discounts and new products, the average consumer is more budget conscious than ever. The digital space not only allows for the increased flow of communication between users, but it also allows for easier, more immediate access to deals and new products. Retailers should take advantage of this, especially since the costs involved are much lower than traditional marketing avenues.Some other numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>4 in 10 consumer\u00a0also say they look for product information on social media</strong></li>\n<li><strong>36 percent want to post/read comments about merchandise or services.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>3. Consumers are a sponge for your brand</strong><em></em></h3>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;3 in 10 consumers who follow retailers via social media say they are actively looking for information about events, current trends and ideas, or photos and videos, such as \u201chow-to\u2019s\u201d and styling ideas, as well as expert opinions&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The internet and digital space is full of so much information that knowing where to get the &#8216;right&#8217; information is often very hard. For a brand, especially a retailer, being able to build a presence and &#8216;own&#8217; your presence is essential. If you don&#8217;t, then you allow others the opportunity to come in and try to represent you.</p>\n<p>Like sponges, consumers that follow your brand are looking to eat up every ounce of new information, new product, and new trend relevant to you. By those accounts, retailers can take advantage of this by curating the consumers experience and <strong>influence</strong> their behavior.<br />\n<strong></strong><br />\n<strong></strong><strong>4. The perfect solution for retail</strong><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1275 aligncenter\" title=\"Gap Pinterest\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Gap-Pinterest.png?resize=500%2C183&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gap Pinterest\" width=\"500\" height=\"183\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Online U.S. consumers report that they follow an average of 9.3 retail companies through Pinterest compared with the average of\u00a06.9 retailers they follow on Facebook and the 8.5 retailers they track via Twitter.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While social media networks like Facebook and Twitter were built for the &#8216;end-user&#8217; in mind, social media platforms have built many features for brands. These include features like Fan pages and Advertisement on Facebook, Verified accounts on Twitter and brand pages on Google +.</p>\n<p>As the study points out, platforms like Pinterest are <em>perfect</em> for retail brands. Pinterest, a pinboard-style social photo sharing website that allows users to create and manage theme-based image collections such as events, interests, hobbies, and more, is perfect for for retailers as it allows them consumers to pin new products and their favorites to share with their community.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>Are you a retailer that is currently using social media?

instead of using an entrance as a way to welcome Facebook users, they could have used an image that <strong>powerfully demonstrates the in-store culture of Free People</strong>.</p>\n<p>Free People takes photos of employees wearing the new season collection. \u00a0So I started thinking, what better way to welcome Facebook users than with the actual employees from a store! \u00a0I decided to create my own Facebook Timeline Cover using the images from their albums:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/free-people-cover-awesome.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-494\" title=\"free-people-cover-awesome\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/free-people-cover-awesome.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>I made the above Timeline Cover in about 10 minutes with Photoshop. \u00a0My image not only welcomes the Facebook user with open arms, but uses people to directly connect with users. \u00a0Even better, this could be a recurring theme because Free People can take a new set of images every season with the new collection.</p>\n<p>If Free People wants to take it a step further, they can take images of real customers after they&#8217;ve tried on the clothing in the fitting room, \u00a0which would be a terrific way to get customers to share the Facebook Page with friends.</p>\n<h3>Get fans excited about a product</h3>\n<p>The goal of a restaurant is to get customers and Fans excited about food.</p>\n<p><strong>What NOT to do</strong>:</p>\n<p>Oink a Doodle Moo shows us another example of an awkward digital camera photo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/oinkadoodlemoo.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-495\" title=\"oinkadoodlemoo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/oinkadoodlemoo.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>I understand that Oink a Doodle Moo wants to welcome users to their Facebook page with open arms &#8211;

does not necessarily drive action. \u00a0When the user sees the app they simply think, &#8220;oh that&#8217;s nice, Carls Jr. welcomes me to their page.&#8221; \u00a0There is no clear reason for the user to click on the app. \u00a0A better phrase is &#8220;<strong>New? Click Here</strong>&#8220;. \u00a0This phrase drives an action because it directly targets first-time visitors.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Carls jr.

data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Furthermore, a first time user gets bombarded with messaging (you can see a screen shot of the Welcome App above). \u00a0Because there are so many different options, the user gets decision paralysis and decides to not click on anything.</p>\n<p>Instead of bombarding the user with choices, the Welcome App should have but 1 simple call to action: <strong>why the user should Like the page</strong>.</p>\n<p>The more Likes a business has, the bigger the audience for posts. \u00a0Give the first-time user a reason to Like and they will.</p>\n<h3>The Photos App</h3>\n<p>The photos app is available by default and is one of the most commonly used apps. \u00a0Check out the clever way in which Starbucks uses the albums to connect with users:</p>\n<p><img

/></p>\n<p>The majority of businesses do not hold as many events as Starbucks, but that doesn\u2019t mean businesses can\u2019t get creative. \u00a0Here are some ideas for photo albums for local\u00a0businesses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Our valued customers</strong>: photo album of your customers</li>\n<li><strong>Customer of the week</strong>: photo album with a customer that won something special that week</li>\n<li><strong>Charity events</strong>: if you hold charity events, this is a great place to put up photos</li>\n<li><strong>Spring collection</strong>: a retail store can put up an album of each season\u2019s collection</li>\n<li><strong>Menu items</strong>: a restaurant can put up an album of all the food</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sign up to a Newsletter

the menu! \u00a0The first 100 fans to join the event win the new item for free.</p>\n<p><strong>Retail idea</strong>: create an event for the launch of a new collection for the season! \u00a0The first

participation and to get Fans to give personal information. \u00a0Use contestes to collect the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Location</li>\n<li>Images of customers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check

motivated and stay consistent. \u00a0It may take several months until fans interact with on a daily basis; don&#8217;t give up until that happens! \u00a0You can succeed by staying persistent.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"How to respond to negative Facebook comments\"></a>How to respond to negative/inflammatory Facebook comments</h2>\n<p>There are times when Facebook Fans write negative comments about the business: perhaps they had a bad experience with a waiter, there was a bug in the food, or the article of clothing they bought was ripped.</p>\n<p><strong>This happens all the time and it will happen to <em>you</em></strong>. \u00a0It&#8217;s important to be prepared and respond in a well thought-out manner. \u00a0The following are steps to take to appropriately answer a Fan&#8217;s complaint and maintain a positive brand image at all times.</p>\n<h3>1. Take a step back and analyze the situation</h3>\n<p>First understand the type of customer and his or her complaint:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1</strong>: the customer is rationale and gives a reason for being upset</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Ex: I bought the happy meal yesterday and it tasted terrible! \u00a0The food was cold and tasted old. \u00a0I want my money back!</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Level 2</strong>: the customer is irrationale and blatantly attacks the business</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Ex: I hate this shop. \u00a0No one should shop here at all!</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Level 3</strong>: the customer uses profanity, racial slurs, or other language that should not be tolerated on a public forum</li>\n<p>Identify the type of customer and then move forward and take the necessary actions.</p>\n<h3>2. Respectfully respond to customers at Level 1 and Level 2</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s of critical importance that complaints issued by fans are addressed. \u00a0<strong>Inactivity appears as though a business has ignored the issue</strong>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a community can see the angry post. \u00a0A business that does not reply shows that it is unconcerned with customer support, which is detrimental to the business reputation.</p>\n<p>The best response illustrates respect and understanding for a customer&#8217;s concerns, and\u00a0<strong>indicates an intention to rectify any problems</strong>.</p>\n<p>How Newegg handles a Level 1 complaint:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-981\" title=\"crazyegg-fan\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/crazyegg-fan-e1337196959107.png?resize=500%2C228&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"228\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>How Zappos handles a Level 2 attack:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-982\" title=\"zappos-customer-service\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/zappos-customer-service-e1337197192344.png?resize=500%2C131&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"131\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h4>How to handle a Level 3 attack</h4>\n<p>If the fan chooses to use profanity or offensive comments that are not appropriate on Facebook, <strong>then you should <em>immediately</em> delete the post</strong>.</p>\n<p>As a principle, never tolerate inappropriate messages on your public forum.</p>\n<h3>3. Be patient and understanding</h3>\n<p>Remember that you know your business better than any Fan. \u00a0What seems like basic, common knowledge to you is often foreign to the customer.</p>\n<p>Take a step back and <strong>put yourself in the customer&#8217;s shoes</strong>. \u00a0This will help you understand why the customer is frustrated. \u00a0The reason that the customer is upset may not be a company error; instead, it may be a simple misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter who is at fault &#8211; <strong>a</strong> <strong>simple apology goes a long way in keeping the customer&#8217;s business</strong>. \u00a0Instead of trying to figure out where the blame lies, turn upset fans into loyal customers by making their experience better.</p>\n<h3>4. Reach out to the fan privately</h3>\n<p>The next step is to send a private message or email to the customer to open up direct options to address his or her complaints. \u00a0The goal is to extend an apologetic hand to the customer and and make sure he or she knows you&#8217;re willing to make it right. \u00a0Move the conversation from a public to a private forum to give the customer a personal touch that signals you care.</p>\n<p>Do not offer direct lines of communication or special discounts publicly. \u00a0This can lead to other people creating problems just to get that special treatment, so it&#8217;s best to keep discounts off the Facebook Wall.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of how Hayneedle resolves a customer issue</strong>:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015\" title=\"hayneedle-example\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/hayneedle-example-e1337279676479.png?resize=500%2C172&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"172\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>5. Ask the fan to remove the post if Level 2</h3>\n<p>Once the problem is resolved and the customer is happy, <strong>politely ask the customer to remove his or her wall post</strong>.</p>\n<p>As you&#8217;ll see in the next step, it is often beneficial to have a solved complaint stay persistent on the wall and have the customer respond that his or her problem was resolved; however, if the\u00a0complaint\u00a0was a Level 2 attack, then it&#8217;s best to get it removed by the user as the attack was irrational in nature.</p>\n<h3>6. Have the fan respond back to the original post if Level 1</h3>\n<p>Once the problem is resolved and the customer is happy, go ahead and politely ask the customer to add a comment to his or her original post that expreses his or her feelings now that the problem is resolved.</p>\n<p>Even a negative post can be a good thing, as long as the last comment is positive. \u00a0Your reputation among your community will soar when they see how well you take care of customers.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"The legal way to run Facebook giveaways and contests\"></a>How to run a legal promotion, sweepstakes, or giveaway on Facebook</h2>\n<p>Promotions and sweepstakes are a great way to get fans engaged and to attract more fans; however, Facebook has some tricky, unexpected rules when it comes to running promotions and sweepstakes on the Facebook platform. \u00a0Read the following information carefully to fully understand how to legally run campaigns.</p>\n<h3>What does Facebook mean by a &#8220;promotion or sweepstakes&#8221;?</h3>\n<p>Directly from Facebook:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A &#8220;sweepstakes&#8221; is a promotion that includes a prize and a winner selected on the basis of chance.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A &#8220;contest&#8221; or &#8220;competition&#8221; is a promotion that includes a prize and a winner determined on the basis of skill (i.e., through judging based on specific criteria).</p>\n<p>Therefore, any campaign on Facebook where a winner is selected falls into the terms of <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook&#8217;s Promotion Guidelines</a>.</p>\n<h3>How to NOT run a promotion</h3>\n<p>Take a look at the following points from Facebook&#8217;s Promotion Guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promotions on Facebook <strong><em>must be</em> administered within Apps</strong> on Facebook.com, either on a Canvas Page or a Page App</li>\n<li>You must not condition registration or entry upon the user taking any action using any Facebook feature or functionality other than liking a Page, checking in to a Place, or connecting to your app. \u00a0For example, you must not condition registration or entry upon the user liking a Wall post, or commenting or uploading a photo on a Wall</li>\n<li>You must not use Facebook features or functionality as a promotion&#8217;s registration or entry mechanism. \u00a0For example, the act of liking a Page or checking in to a Place cannot automatically register or enter a promotion participant</li>\n<li>You must not use Facebook features or\u00a0functionality, such as the Like button, as a voting mechanism for a promotion</li>\n<li>You must not notify winners\u00a0through\u00a0Facebook, such as through Facebook messages, chat, or posts on profiles (timelines) or Pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Simply put, do NOT use any of Facebook&#8217;s features as a prerequisite to enter a promotion.</p>\n<h3>How to run a promotion</h3>\n<p>The legal way to run a promotion through Facebook is to utilize a 3rd party application. \u00a0Companies such as Wildfire provide an easy-to-use, cost-effective solution for local businesses.</p>\n<p>You can check out their pricing on this page right here.</p>\n<p>Here it is for your easy browsing:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021\" title=\"wildfire-pricing\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/wildfire-pricing-e1337283270710.png?resize=500%2C245&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"245\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>The step-by-step process of how it works</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re confused, here is the simple step-by-step process of how to set up a promotion:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign up to an app-builder platform such as Wildfire</li>\n<li>Use the platform to build a campaign</li>\n<li>Set it up on a Facebook page (they will have step-by-step instructions for how to do this)</li>\n<li>Tell fans to enter the contest</li>\n<li>Fans submit their name and email to enter the contest</li>\n<li>Choose a random winner</li>\n<li>Notify the winner via email</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"How to run effective advertisements on Facebook\"></a>How to run effective advertisements on Facebook</h2>\n<p>Facebook ads are effective for a local business because of location-specific targeting. \u00a0For example, a business can target Facebook users that are between the ages of 18 &#8211; 25 that live within 15 miles of the area code 94040. \u00a0In this way, a business can make sure that only relevant, highly targeted people see the ads.</p>\n<p>Pricing for ads is similar to Google adwords: Facebook provides a CPC or CPM pricing structure.</p>\n<p><strong>CPC</strong> (cost per click): pay only when a user clicks on an advertisement</p>\n<p><strong>CPM</strong> (cost per impression): pay based on how many times an advertisement is viewed. \u00a0CPM is structured on a per 1,000 views model. For example, a $20 CPM means that a business pays $20 for 1,000 views of an ad.</p>\n<h3>All about targeting</h3>\n<p>The more specific the targeting, the better the advertising. \u00a0This is what a business sees by default:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022\" title=\"default-facebook-targeting\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/default-facebook-targeting-e1337283997446.png?resize=500%2C237&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"237\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>By default, an ad targets more than 142 million people in the United States. \u00a0Quite a lot of people and very un-targeted.</p>\n<p>Lets start our targeting with the Location field.</p>\n<h4>Location</h4>\n<p>I recommend that local merchants utilize the &#8220;By City&#8221; option and include cities within 10 miles. \u00a0This gives a strong radius of potential customers to target.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023\" title=\"location-field\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/location-field.png?resize=477%2C183&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"477\" height=\"183\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h4>Demographics</h4>\n<p>Pretty self explanatory. \u00a0A store owner should understand what type of customer shops most at the store. \u00a0For example, a local boutique for women&#8217;s clothing should only target women.</p>\n<p>Be as specific as possible with an ad. \u00a0You can always create 1 ad to target men, and another ad to target women.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024\" title=\"demographics-field\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/demographics-field.png?resize=478%2C118&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"478\" height=\"118\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Interests</strong></p>\n<p>I like to switch to &#8220;Switch to Broad Targeting&#8221; because the option gives categories that are effective in targeting users based on interests.</p>\n<p>In my example, I chose to target people who are interested in Photography, Fashion, Beauty Products, and Pop Culture.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025\" title=\"Interest-field\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Interest-field.png?resize=500%2C267&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"267\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h4>Advanced Targeting Options</h4>\n<p>A wedding photographer should use the Advanced Demographics field to target people who are &#8220;Engaged&#8221;.</p>\n<p>A student loans company should target users with the &#8220;In College&#8221; or &#8220;In High School&#8221; fields.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026\" title=\"advanced-targeting-field\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/advanced-targeting-field.png?resize=500%2C305&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"305\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve refined our targeting options, check out our new estimated reach:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027\" title=\"estimated-reach\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/estimated-reach.png?resize=198%2C227&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"198\" height=\"227\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve refined our selection down to 35,320 people in my local area. \u00a0In this way, I can spend my advertisement dollars wisely on the people that are highly likely to shop at my location.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>Now that you know how to use Facebook for local marketing, you need to go out there and do it! \u00a0It&#8217;s all about execution at this point. \u00a0As the business owner, it&#8217;s up to you to build your social presence.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and if you have any questions, shoot me an email at Jun [at] RewardMe.com</p>\n",

WordPress is great because not only does it have an abundance of resources available (<a title=\"Wordpress Themes ThemeForest\" href=\"http://themeforest.net\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress themes</a>, <a title=\"WordPress Plugins\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress plugins</a>, etc.), but it also has a large community of experts that you can turn-to when it comes to support.</p>\n<p>Additionally, WordPress is multi-purpose. By this, I mean that it can be used for an array of different projects. Whether it&#8217;s as your businesses consumer facing website or a photo blog, WordPress has excellent flexibility and is suitable for most, if not all projects.</p>\n<h3><strong>7) What is Pinterest? Should I use it?</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1228 aligncenter\" title=\"Pinterest Example\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Pinterest-Example.png?resize=499%2C207&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pinterest Example\" width=\"499\" height=\"207\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><a title=\"Pinterest\" href=\"http://pinterest.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a> is a pinboard-style social photo sharing website that allows users to create and manage theme-based image collections such as events, interests, hobbies, and more. An easy way to think about it is as virtual push-pin board where you can take your favorite images and post them with category tags/notes.</p>\n<p>From a business standpoint, Pinterest can be an excellent tool if you want to show off photos of your food products, new products, and fun pictures of your business such as an event.</p>\n<p>As the Pinterest community is based off visuals and a certain level of creativity, consider first if you even have anything &#8216;worth&#8217; talking/&#8217;pinning.&#8217;</p>\n<h3><strong>8 ) What is Instagram? Should I use it?</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1229 aligncenter\" title=\"Instagram Example\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Instagram-Example.jpg?resize=500%2C373&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Instagram Example\" width=\"500\" height=\"373\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Instagram is a free, smartphone photo sharing app that allows users to take a photo, apply a digital filter to it, and then share it on a variety of social networking services, including Instagram&#8217;s own.</p>\n<p>Similar to Pinterest, Instagram is all about the visuals. Can you tell a story with your photos? If so, then Instagram is for you. Clothing brands, restaurants, photographers and even models are all great examples of some of the top brands who use Instagram.</p>\n<p>Remember, the goal isn&#8217;t to just to use a platform because that&#8217;s what all the cool kids are doing. The goal is to be relevant.</p>\n<h3><strong>9) Is there any way to capture my customers emails via Facebook and Twitter?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Yes and no.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>No:</strong> If you have a Facebook page or Twitter account, just because they follow or friend you doesn&#8217;t mean you get their email address.</p>\n<p><strong>Yes:</strong> If you want to grow a database that you can later market to with offers and promotions, there are several ways to go about this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funnel users (Facebook, Twitter) &#8211; You can use your social networks as a distribution channel where in you can post content and updates that will lead them to a site or destination (ie: contest) for email capture.</li>\n<li>Facebook App (Facebook) &#8211; There are quite a few solutions available in the market that will allow you to capture fan emails through the use of a Facebook App. When a user &#8216;opts&#8217; into your app, one of the data items that you may ask your user for is their email as part of the opt-in process. Word of caution: Facebook app engagement levels fluctuate and are not guaranteed to return on your investment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>10) What are some good social media resources to stay updated?</strong></h3>\n<p>(Aside from ourselves!) We recommend checking out the following sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Mashable\" href=\"http://Mashable.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mashable </a></li>\n<li>ReadWriteWeb</li>\n<li><a title=\"Social Media Examiner\" href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media Examiner\u00a0</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"ProBlogger\" href=\"http://problogger.com\" target=\"_blank\">Problogger</a></li>\n<li>Quick Sprout</li>\n<li><a title=\"Social Media Today\" href=\"http://socialmediatoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media Today</a></li>\n<li>RewardMe Blog (That&#8217;s us!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>Still have questions?

they&#8217;ll leave your website and look for someone else that is willing to answer their questions.</p>\n<h3>How did you get started with content marketing?</h3>\n<p>Marcus used Hubspot, which is an all-in-one tool to track online marketing and inbound leads.\u00a0 Marcus used it so well that he is now a partner that uses Hubspot to coach his clients how to get inbound leads.</p>\n<p>This whole thing about social media is worthless unless you&#8217;re making money and closing sales.\u00a0 You can&#8217;t do stuff that doesn&#8217;t&#8217; make money; you need to track it and Hubspot tracks it.</p>\n<h3>How much does Hubspot cost?</h3>\n<p>Depends on the size of the business and how many leads you have in the system.</p>\n<p>Marcus&#8217; average Hubspot customer spends $4,000 &#8211; $5,000 per year.</p>\n<p>Before Hubspot, Marcus used to spend $250,000 per year on marketing and advertising costs, which generated $4M in sales per year.</p>\n<p>Now with inbound marketing and Hubspot, Marcus spends $20,000 per year and makes $5M in sales per year.</p>\n<p>The real price that Marcus paid is that his bed time changed to do the work.\u00a0 At 11pm at night, he&#8217;d get home from a sales appointment, open his laptop, and get to writing a blog post.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no such thing as not having time to do good marketing &#8211; the actual phrase should be, &#8220;It&#8217;s just not that important to me right now.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>How did you drive traffic to the site to get inbound leads</h3>\n<p>Marcus&#8217; industry was completely open for the taking.\u00a0 He was the only person online writing answer to the questions people had for the pool industry.</p>\n<p>Google finally found someone that was answering questions for the pool industry.\u00a0 Because of that, he ranked first for thousands of keyword results.</p>\n<p>If Marcus&#8217; was ever asked a question that he had not yet written about on his blog, he would write the question down, and then write an answer to it on his blog when he got back home.</p>\n<p>Nothing about this is scientific &#8211; it&#8217;s all about being consistent, persistent, and hard working.</p>\n<p>If someone hangs around your website long enough, they&#8217;re going to become your customer eventually.</p>\n<h3>Tell me about the buying guide</h3>\n<p>Marcus&#8217; business partner wrote it.\u00a0 It&#8217;s 9 pages long and it took him about a day and a half to write.\u00a0 The content was already written; it was a combination of certain blog articles that were written.\u00a0 All he did was organize it and put it together on a PDF.</p>\n<h3>How do you use the emails that you collect?</h3>\n<p>Marcus uses forms to lead track.</p>\n<p>When you fill out a form, Marcus can track all the pages that you&#8217;ve looked at.\u00a0 This allows Marcus to be better equipped when making a sale because he knows exactly what the potential buyer is interested in.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Marcus wants to nurture you with content.\u00a0 By sending emails, he can provide more content to the consumer and continue to build trust.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Marcus uses emails to make announcements.\u00a0 He can send an email to customers to let them know that he&#8217;s having a summer sale and to hop on board now to take advantage of the price savings.</p>\n<h3>What is the buying cycle and every stage of the sales process?</h3>\n<p>Marcus doesn&#8217;t give people a choice.</p>\n<p>Before Marcus goest to a house to give a quote, he requires that the customer download and read his content so that the customer knows as much as possible about his product. \u00a0He makes it clear that when he goes to a house, he&#8217;s there NOT to give a quote, but to earn the business. \u00a0He will of course answer any questions that the potential customer may have, but the customer must have done his research before hand.</p>\n<p>This is an excellent way of qualifying the customer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Especially if it&#8217;s just one person who is managing the &#8216;social media&#8217; side of the business, it&#8217;s easy to overlook the little changes that occur everyday on Twitter, Facebook, and more.</p>\n<p>Just how in school the teacher says &#8220;there are no stupid questions,&#8221; the same goes for questions regarding social media. It&#8217;s better to ask and know rather than try and find out.</p>\n<p>With that said, here are 10 common social media questions that we get from small business owners</p>\n<h3><strong>1.) Facebook, Twitter or both?</strong></h3>\n<p>Most businesses can benefit from having a presence on both Twitter and Facebook, but one thing to consider is to what extent and how you will use the platforms.<!--more--></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1134 aligncenter\" title=\"Naked Pizza Facebook\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Naked-Pizza-Facebook.png?resize=500%2C314&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Naked Pizza Facebook\" width=\"500\" height=\"314\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Facebook is great for sharing content/news about your brand while Twitter is great for direct engagement with your target audience. A business may want to use Facebook to share photos, deals and news (Naked Pizza is the example shown) while using Twitter to engage with users relevant to their business or as a customer service tool.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that most not all businesses can benefit from both. In some instances, such as when the business has no consumer facing interface, only one of the social media platforms may fit.</p>\n<h3><strong>2.) How many Facebook fans or Twitter followers is a good number?</strong></h3>\n<p>The best answer to this is to not worry about your numbers. Yes, it&#8217;s great to be able to say you have 1,000 followers on Twitter, but what matters is the engagement level of your community.</p>\n<p>A simple way to put it is this: Would you rather have 100 followers/friends that promote your brand for you, share your content, and talk about you to their friends, or 10,000 followers/friends who are not engaged with your brand?</p>\n<h3><strong>3) Should I reply to all posts from Facebook/Twitter users?</strong></h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1138 aligncenter\" title=\"Whole Foods Social Media\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Whole-Foods-Social-Media.png?resize=498%2C218&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Whole Foods Social Media\" width=\"498\" height=\"218\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Whole-Foods-Social-Media.png?w=532&amp;ssl=1 532w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Whole-Foods-Social-Media.png?resize=300%2C131&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>You can, but we suggest you pick the right battles. The best way to determine if you should reply back is to weigh the value of the comment. Is it answering a question about your business? If you let it go, will it hurt your brand? (ie: A rumor about your brand.), will responding cause more bad than good (ie: sports team that replies back to an fan that is angry that they lost)?</p>\n<p>For instances where a user is asking a questions about your business (ie: product, hours of operation, etc.), you should always consider these as the top priority for responses.</p>\n<h3><strong>4) Do I need to hire someone to manage my social media presence?</strong></h3>\n<p>The exact position title of the person who would manage your social media strategy and presence would be a Community Manager. To determine if you should bring someone to fill that role consider the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many hours are you currently spending on social media?</li>\n<li>Where are you in your social media strategy: just starting out, building community, advanced, etc.?</li>\n<li>Is there someone internally who can take over the role and is versed in social media?</li>\n<li>Where do you want your social media efforts to be in 6 months?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on how you answer the questions above, it should give you a better feel of whether or not you will need to bring someone in to help you manage.</p>\n<h3><strong>5) How do I get people to find my business?</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1135 aligncenter\" title=\"Social Media Signage\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Social-Media-Signage.png?resize=499%2C307&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Social Media Signage\" width=\"499\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Social-Media-Signage.png?w=687&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Social-Media-Signage.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>One of the most effective ways to get people to &#8216;find&#8217; your business on social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter is word of mouth. If you have a physical business location, such as a restaurant, use a combination of in-store signage and employees telling customers where they can find you online. You can even offer an incentive for customers to &#8216;connect&#8217; with you on Facebook or Twitter by offering special offers available only online.</p>\n<p>Another way to get the attention of your target audience is through paid advertising.</p>\n<p>For Facebook, this would be through Facebook Ads. Through Facebook&#8217;s ad platform, you will be able to create and customize advertising campaigns to fit your target audience.</p>\n<p>For Twitter, paid advertising would be in the form of Twitter&#8217;s Promoted Tweets, Accounts and Trends. To figure out what type would fit your business best, consult Twitter&#8217;s advertising guide.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a budget for advertising, another way to get people to find your business is to use local publications to do coverage of your business and to include notes within the publication on where they can learn more. For example, in the local newspaper there was a feature article on a local bakery and how they made their special cupcakes. At the end of the article, it had a note about how I can watch the full video and also sign-up to their special invite only tasting event on their Facebook page.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>What questions do you have about social media do you have that you would like us to answer in Part 2?

If you are business owner, Google has a special place called Google Places where you can customize and optimize our business for searches.<!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>The basics of how it works</strong></h3>\n<p>If you have ever wanted to look up directions or where a particular business was located, there is a good chance that you used Google Maps before. To use Google Maps, simply enter in the address or location (ex: City) and you will be shown a map layout of the area. In most cases, Google will allow you to zoom in on an area all the way to street level. For this example, we&#8217;ll use Santa Monica, CA:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1102 aligncenter\" title=\"Santa Monica\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Santa-Monica.png?resize=500%2C340&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Santa Monica\" width=\"500\" height=\"340\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>From here, you can type in the business you are looking which will then show you a list of all the businesses that fit that keyword in the area you have specified in the earlier step. Here is an example of what we see for the keyword &#8220;movie theater&#8221;:<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1103 aligncenter\" title=\"Movie Theater Results - Google Maps\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Movie-Theater-Results-Google-Maps.png?resize=500%2C237&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Movie Theater Results - Google Maps\" width=\"500\" height=\"237\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>The results that are shown are a combination between paid advertisements by the businesses and local business listings from Google Places.</p>\n<p>The paid advertisements are generated directly from <a title=\"Google AdWords\" href=\"https://adwords.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google AdWords</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do I use Google Local Search to my advantage?</strong></h3>\n<p>After you have a good understanding of what Google Local Search/Google Maps is, the next step is to make sure that your business is properly listed and setup via Google Places.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1110 aligncenter\" title=\"Google Places - Fraiche\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Google-Places-Fraiche.png?resize=499%2C303&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Google Places - Fraiche\" width=\"499\" height=\"303\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Once logged in to your <a title=\"Create Google Account\" href=\"https://accounts.google.com/NewAccount\" target=\"_blank\">Google account</a> and on the <a title=\"Google Places\" href=\"http://www.google.com/places/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Places page</a>, you will be able to build out your businesses listing page where you can customize information such as contact information and locations. Remember that the more complete you are with your listing, the better results you will have when people search for key terms related to your business.</p>\n<p>If you are looking to take a bigger step in the direction of Google Maps, you can also consider using Google AdWords which is Google&#8217;s pay-per-click advertising platform. Using Google AdWords you will be able to make search customizations such as having your ad show up only for users within a specific region.</p>\n<p>Before jumping into AdWords, we suggest first setting up your Google Places account and seeing if that is a good enough bump for your business.</p>\n<p>Remember that Google Maps isn&#8217;t necessarily the solution that will lead to booming traffic, but that it is important to any marketing strategy online.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>Are you currently using Google Maps for your business?

Restaurants in particular are slowly, but surely joining in the race. While some are better at utilizing Facebook pages and all of its features, there is still a large percentage of restaurants that are still in the &#8216;make or break stage&#8217; of Facebook.</p>\n<p>By the &#8216;make or break stage,&#8217; we refer to the time period in which a brand may become frustrated at poor results which may discourage them from moving forward with social media. Rather than feeling like your efforts are <em>wasted </em>and that there is no hope, consider the following tips on how restaurants can increase their Facebook fan base and presence.</p>\n<h3><strong>Facebook Layout</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1080 aligncenter\" title=\"Mooyah Facebook Page\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Mooyah-Facebook-Page.png?resize=500%2C295&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mooyah Facebook Page\" width=\"500\" height=\"295\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>When you walk into an Apple store, the experience in itself is part of their value proposition. In the same sense, consider your Facebook fan page as your very own Apple store. Everything from your Facebook timeline to your Facebook Cover page image should be optimized and branded for your business.<!--more--></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Checklist:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook Cover Image</li>\n<li>Facebook Timeline (milestones, highlighted stories, visibility)</li>\n<li>About information</li>\n<li>Photos (visibility, organization &#8211; albums, captions)</li>\n<li>Page permissions (admins, posting permissions by fans)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Fan Page Badge </strong></h3>\n<p title=\"Facebook Fan Page Badge\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1085 aligncenter\" title=\"Facebook Mooyah Widget\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Facebook-Mooyah-Widget.png?resize=320%2C606&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Facebook Mooyah Widget\" width=\"320\" height=\"606\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Using <a title=\"Facebook Badges\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/badges/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook&#8217;s creative center and tools</a>, you are able to create a <a title=\"Facebook Like Widget\" href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like-box/\" target=\"_blank\">Fan Page Like Box</a> that can be embedded onto other websites and blogs. Aside from allowing fans to see your Facebook Fan Pages&#8217; latest updates, it can also be customized to show photos, different border colors and any embed size.</p>\n<h3><strong>Get visual, get fans </strong></h3>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes that a business can make with their Facebook Page is to neglect the visual component and storytelling that Facebook makes possible. Using Facebook&#8217;s Photo sharing features, consider posting images of dishes off your menu, your restaurants environment, special events and even your happy customers.</p>\n<p><em>Remember:</em> A user is more likely to engage with an image that grabs their attention than a page full of only text. <strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Paid Advertising: Facebook Ads</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>If </strong>you have a budget, Facebook ads can be a good option for driving traffic to your Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Before you jump in though, we provide a word of caution: Facebook ads are only as effective as the work that goes into it.</p>\n<p>If you are new to Facebook ads, take some time to familiarize yourself with the the terminology and process in setting up your Facebook ads (CPM, Audience, Location, Friends of Friends, etc.). One of the biggest mistakes that business owners make is thinking that Facebook ads will immediately drive traffic and engagement, which is false. Facebook ad campaigns should be optimized for your audience and targeted so that your marketing dollars are spent wisely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Team Effort</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1077 aligncenter\" title=\"Facebook-Restaurant-Marketing\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Facebook-Restaurant-Marketing.jpg?resize=351%2C528&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"351\" height=\"528\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Helen Keller once said\u00a0\u00a0&#8220;Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.&#8221; Using that same message, remember that social media in general is a team effort. Educate your staff on the proper way to use social media and even your own customers on how they can connect with you on Facebook. Even before going to customers and telling them to follow you on Facebook, it&#8217;s important to first get your own team to &#8216;buy in&#8217; otherwise you will be a 1 man team.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>What steps are you taking to increase your Facebook fan base and presence?

While there are some very blatant way to accomplish this such as cutting back on the quality of the food and paying your workers less, these are not &#8216;ideal&#8217; solutions. Rather, these would be considered cutting corners.</p>\n<p>There are many ways for a restaurant to increase their profitability as well as the foot traffic that they get and would like to share 5 tips that we feel every restaurant owners should consider in regards to profitability:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Social Media </strong>We&#8217;ve mentioned it before, but we&#8217;ll mention it again. Social Media can be daunting and scary, but at the same time it can be a powerful marketing tool for a business. By using social media as communication tool , you can build relationships that keep your business top of mind with potential customers. By using it as a brand monitoring tool, you can listen to what people are saying, both good and bad. When used effectively as a whole, social media has the potential to help a restaurant increase it&#8217;s brand awareness and most importantly, it&#8217;s profits. <strong><!--more--><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Email Marketing </strong>We mentioned how social media can be a great tool for staying in touch with customers, but another way that can be an effective strategy is email marketing campaigns. By collecting and building out email databases of customers that have dined in your restaurant, you will be able to market to them special dining opportunities, new menu items and even a special dessert for their birthday.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of how <a title=\"Flemings Steakhouse\" href=\"http://www.flemingssteakhouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fleming&#8217;s Steakhouse</a> sends out creative email campaigns during seasonal holiday and events:</p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1037 aligncenter\" title=\"Flemings eNewsletter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Flemings-eNewsletter.png?resize=500%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Flemings eNewsletter\" width=\"500\" height=\"381\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Menu Pricing </strong>Rather than making &#8216;gut feeling&#8217; calls on how to price your menu items, consider using the following tips on how to set menu prices that are accurate and most importantly competitive. Remember that setting your prices to be reasonable, doesn&#8217;t mean that you are sacrificing profitability. <strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. Local Searches </strong>Aside from word of mouth referrals and passerby&#8217;s, another way that customers find what restaurant to eat at is through local searches online. Restaurant owners should take the time to look up what information is available on their business when searching for key terms related to it. Often, potential customers will be able to look up menu prices and items, locations, and reviews on a business. Make sure that what is online accurately reflects your business. (It would be embarrassing if the address for your restaurant was listed incorrectly.)</p>\n<p>Google is a great place to start your search about your restaurant:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1040 aligncenter\" title=\"Local Search\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Local-Search.png?resize=500%2C354&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Local Search\" width=\"500\" height=\"354\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>5. Focus on creating repeat customers </strong>Repeat customers are the lifeline of many restaurants. Not only do they dine at a restaurant on a regular basis, but they often tell their friends which can lead to more revenue. Because of their importance, restaurant owners should consider the value in creating a <a title=\"RewardMe\" href=\"http://rewardme.com\">loyalty program</a> for its customers. Specifically, by creating a loyalty program, a business will not only be able to reward their most loyal customers, but also learn more information about them such as their frequency and what they buy. *Note that data capture of this nature is only available with certain loyalty programs.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>What are some things that you have done to increase the profitability of your restaurant? We would love to hear them!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Aside from letting customers know directly at your business locations through signage, if your business has a website, you can have a link on your website that allow customers to know how they may reach you on Twitter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-989 aligncenter\" title=\"Twitter widget\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Twitter-widget.png?resize=500%2C190&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Twitter widget\" width=\"500\" height=\"190\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />If your business has a website, we suggest using <a title=\"Twitter Widget\" href=\"https://twitter.com/about/resources/widgets\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter&#8217;s Widget</a> Creator which allows you to customize a widget for your website or even for your Facebook page.</p>\n<h3><strong>Find the influencers on Twitter</strong></h3>\n<p>Another great way that Twitter can play into a businesses marketing strategy is in identifying key influencers.

Here is a snapshot of Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s Food Truck:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-992 aligncenter\" title=\"Klout\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Klout.png?resize=500%2C189&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"189\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />As you can see, if I were a business that is looking to partner with someone who is influential about Ice Cream in the Seattle area, they might be the perfect candidate. As Twitter is like a megaphone, finding the user with the biggest &#8216;voice&#8217; is the perfect way to make sure that your message is getting heard and by the right audience.</p>\n<p>Once you have identified the influencers that attract the audience that you are looking to build relationships with, reach out to them and to see what kind of synergy there might be. Some creative ways to build partnerships include offering special access (ie: early access to products), invitations to dine at your restaurant (great for reviews) and creating titles/groups for your biggest supporters (ie: Mike&#8217;s Super Sub Twitter Team.)</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>Is your business using Twitter?

As a business owner, having the right individual to lead your digital marketing initiatives can be the difference between creating relevance and creating noise. In today&#8217;s current digital climate, where everyone calls themselves a social media expert, this can be an especially difficult task.</p>\n<p>While the traditional route in filling a position is to post a job opening on a job board or in some cases a recruiting agency, employers are looking toward social media to find the right talent for their digital positions such as community managers and digital marketing coordinators. From Twitter to blogs, the amount of talent available is abundant; the hard part is finding the quality.</p>\n<p>If you are currently in the process of hiring or evaluating your digital marketing team, here are 5 things to consider when choosing an individual to lead your digital marketing efforts:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Brand Awareness</strong> &#8211; Perhaps the most important factor to consider, the individual who leads your brand online should be someone who has a full understanding of your brand, past and present. From knowing how the company started to knowing how the brand has evolved (product, brand message, etc.), having a firm understanding and foundation of the brand will be reflected in their level of engagement and creativity.<!--more--></p>\n<p><strong>2. ROI</strong> &#8211; As making money is the most common reason for starting a business, asking the candidate about what they believe the ROI of their digital marketing efforts will be is a must. While branding and &#8216;awareness&#8217; are definitely important results of digital marketing, at the end of the day if it doesn&#8217;t generate or lead to some sort of revenue, it&#8217;s just frosting without a cake. Remember to never sight of what the goal is.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Experience</strong> &#8211; This is standard for any job. Knowing the level of experience that candidates have is one of the first things you look at. For positions in the digital space, it&#8217;s important to look at the following in particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Types of projects and industry?</li>\n<li>ROI &#8211; Was the goal to generate revenue or just awareness?</li>\n<li>Role in the projects</li>\n<li>Platforms used &#8211; Only Twitter? Only Facebook? If so, why?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Creativity</strong> &#8211; The digital space is like a blank canvas. You have the opportunity to create something brand new or you can copy what someone else has done. Ultimately, it&#8217;s up to you as far as how creative an individual you need, but having an individual who innovates and creates new ideas has its advantages. Check out this great campaign by Bing for Jay-Z to see how creative things can get:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/XNic4wf8AYg?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"313\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>5. Direction</strong> &#8211; A final thought to consider when selecting the right person for the job is what they envision being the future of your brand. Is it to grow into new markets? New product lines? As the person that leads your entire digital presence, they will play an important role in shaping the direction your company and brand grows. Be sure to bring on someone who will compliment your future plans.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>What are some things you look for when bringing in someone to lead your marketing efforts?

Contrary to popular belief, being successful with your local marketing doesn&#8217;t mean you need to have a huge budget. While it helps, execution and a clear, well-thought out strategy is often the key determinant.</p>\n<p>Depending on who your target consumers are as well as other factors, such as the type of business (grocery store, gas station, etc.), there are many marketing avenues that a business may choose to take. On the digital end there is Facebook and Twitter while for those looking for a more traditional approach there are press releases and mailers.</p>\n<h3><strong>So what is local marketing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Also known as &#8216;neighborhood marketing,&#8217; local marketing generally refers to any marketing techniques a business uses to market and promote itself to the area in which it operates. In most cases, local marketing often becomes the responsibility of the franchisee with the parent company being responsible for the national and regional marketing initiatives. An example of this is how McDonald&#8217;s would focus on national advertisements that focus on brand awareness and new products that will be at all the stores across the nation, while the individual franchise owner may promote special deals they have on Monday&#8217;s at their own location.<!--more--></p>\n<p>If you are looking to jump-start your local marketing, here are four easy tips on how to gain the interest of those in the area around you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Events </strong><br />\nOne of the best ways to create interest and buzz in your business is to create special events.

As the saying goes, first impressions play a big role in a relationship; use a kick-off or an annual event as a way to stay connected with your local area.<strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_886\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-886\" style=\"width: 469px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Whole-Foods-Market-Community-Event1.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-886\" title=\"Whole Foods Market Community Event\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Whole-Foods-Market-Community-Event1.png?resize=469%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Whole Foods Market Community Event\" width=\"469\" height=\"300\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-886\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Santa Cruz Whole Foods Market Community Event</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n<p>If you are looking for a great example of how a business is using events to stay connected and engaged with their community check out your local <a title=\"Whole Foods Market\" href=\"http://wholefoods.com\" target=\"_blank\">Whole Foods Market</a>. Although stores are supported by corporate nationally, each location hosts their own special events for shoppers</li>\n<li><strong>Partnerships </strong><br />\nAnother opportunity that businesses should explore is partnerships with other local businesses as well as non-businesses organization. An example of a non-business organization is the local high school.</p>\n<p>One strategy that is effective is to partner up with a school program at the locals schools through performance based donations (ie: $100 for every win, etc.) as well as through catering school functions. The plus side of these opportunities is that you will brand yourself as part of the community playing off of the &#8216;support your local business&#8217; mentality.</li>\n<li><strong>Local PR<br />\n</strong><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Local-PR.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-899 aligncenter\" title=\"Local PR\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Local-PR.png?resize=480%2C156&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Local PR\" width=\"480\" height=\"156\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>When most people think of PR, they think of dollar signs. It&#8217;s true that press releases and PR assistance often comes with a price, but there are still plenty of options of the dollar conscious businesses owner. Some strategies to gain some local PR includes hosting invite only events to local media outlets (ie: newspaper, local news, etc.) and early previews of new products<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Word of Mouth<br />\n</strong>Never underestimate the power of a good recommendation. As most marketers will tell you, the strongest ally of a businesses is a positive recommendation of your businesses from one person to another. Just how a letter of recommendation can be the make or break in getting a job, recommendations are forms of endorsements by individuals who are putting their credibility on the line for your business.With that in mind, a business should always look for ways to improve the customers experience. Especially from a local marketing perspective where in corporate will not be able to help, <strong>knowing what your customer thinks of your business</strong> will not only help you improve, but also know what you are doing right.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>How do you market to your local area?

April 2012 (270 days)</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>1,400 locations</li>\n<li>200,000 users</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lets analyze the data to get numbers that are useful to a merchant:</p>\n<p><strong>Users per location</strong>: on average, there are 143 users per location</p>\n<p><strong>New users per day</strong>: on average, 741 new users sign up per day</p>\n<p><strong>New users <em>per location</em> per day</strong>: on average, there are .53 new users per location per day</p>\n<h3>RewardMe</h3>\n<p>For the comparison, we will use the numbers generated from our fast casual restaurant client located in Texas with 16 locations:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: date range from December 2011 &#8211; April 2012 (150 days)</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Franchise with 16 locations using RewardMe</li>\n<li>39,008 users</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lets do the same analysis that we did for Belly above:</p>\n<p><strong>Users per location</strong>: on average, we have 2,438 users per location</p>\n<p><strong>New users per day</strong>: on average, 260 new users sign up per day</p>\n<p><strong>New users <em>per location</em> per day</strong>: on average, we have 16.25 new users per location per day</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">RewardMe has 31x the customer sign-up rate as Belly: 16.25 new users <em>per location</em> per day vs .53 new users <em>per location</em> per day</h4>\n<h2>Participation Rate</h2>\n<h3>Belly</h3>\n<p>According to the article by <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/08/customer-loyalty-and-rewards-platform-for-local-businesses-belly-raises-10m-from-andreessen-horowitz/\" target=\"_blank\">Tech Crunch</a>, Belly has achieved the following numbers:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: date range of August 2011 &#8211; April 2012 (270 days)</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>200,000 users</li>\n<li>800,000 check-ins</li>\n</ol>\n<div><strong>Check-ins per day</strong>: on average, there are 2,963 check-ins per day</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Check-ins per <em>location</em> per day</strong>: on average, there are 2.12 check-ins per location per day</div>\n<h3>RewardMe</h3>\n<p>For the comparison, we will again use the numbers generated from our fast casual restaurant client located in Texas with 16 locations:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: date range from December 2011 &#8211; April 2012 (150 days)</em></p>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>39,008 users</li>\n<li>81,410 check-ins</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Check-ins per day</strong>: on average, we have 543 check-ins per day</p>\n<p><strong>Check-ins per <em>location</em> per day</strong>: on average, we have 33.92 check-ins per location per day</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">RewardMe has 16x the customer check-in rate as Belly: 33.92 check-ins per day vs 2.12 checkins per day</h4>\n</div>\n<h2>Return on Investment</h2>\n<h3>Belly</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately the CNET article did not mention anything about ROI for Belly merchants. \u00a0I encourage the Belly team to post their ROI numbers as a follow up to this post for a fair comparison.</p>\n<h3>RewardMe</h3>\n<p>The following numbers are for our fast casual franchise client.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Participation rate</strong>: <strong>20.2%</strong> of all customers use RewardMe</li>\n<li><strong>We capture the RIGHT customers</strong>: RewardMe members spend <strong>24.8%</strong> more than non-RewardMe members</li>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Note</strong>: this population selection effect should not be confused with revenue lift, which is detailed below</em></li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Revenue lift for RewardMe members</strong>: a revenue lift of <strong>5.7%</strong> is directly attributed to gamification <em>(lift % is a statistically sound calculation independent of the effects of population selection and random environmental factors)</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most importantly, a recent case study of a client revealed that because RewardMe captures 20.2% of customers, RewardMe has generated a <strong>2% bottom-line revenue increase</strong>\u00a0for our client over a 7-month period.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>If a rewards program cannot prove a statistically sound measurement for ROI, then there is no proof that the rewards program benefits its clients. \u00a0We&#8217;d like to see Belly demonstrate measurable ROI for its clients.</p>\n<h2>Reward Structure and Customization</h2>\n<h3>Belly</h3>\n<p>Belly rewards points based on visits.</p>\n<h3>RewardMe</h3>\n<p>RewardMe rewards points based on <em>dollars spent</em> or visits</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>A merchant can use RewardMe to fully customize their rewards program and ensure that their best customers get the best rewards. \u00a0For example, a customer that buys a soft drink can receive 10 points, while a customer that buys an entire burger meal can receive 100 points.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, merchants are severely limited with Belly. \u00a0A customer that buys a soft drink will receive as many points as a customer that buys an entire burger meal.</p>\n<p>Because Belly is limited to a visit-based rewards program, RewardMe has a far superior, more customizable rewards program.</p>\n<h2>Data Capture</h2>\n<h3>Belly</h3>\n<p>Belly does not capture point of sale data; therefore, Belly does not know how much money was spent or what was purchased.</p>\n<p>Belly does capture the following data points via their mobile application:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Email</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>RewardMe</h3>\n<p>RewardMe has a patent-pending technology that allows us to capture important point of sale data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dollars spent</li>\n<li>Items purchased</li>\n<li>Timestamp</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The unique identifier for a customer is their mobile number. \u00a0A customer can choose to opt-into the merchant&#8217;s text club at sign-up.</p>\n<p>RewardMe <em>always</em> captures mobile number, and captures email through a follow up text.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>A merchant can use RewardMe for deep, BIG DATA analysis of customer purchase patterns and behaviors. \u00a0<em>Merchants of all sizes, from the mom and pop shop on the corner to the largest restaurants and retailers, can capture, analyze and develop actionable, targeted marketing based on information including but not limited to</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer specific data</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Which customers have spent more than $100 in the past 30 days</li>\n<li>Which customers make purchases on weekdays vs weekends</li>\n<li>Which customers love burgers vs salads</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Demographic data</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Average age of customers</li>\n<li>Average income level of customers</li>\n<li>Location distribution of customers</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Targeting data</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Which customers buy salads but not pizza</li>\n<li>Which customers haven&#8217;t returned in the past 30 days</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div><strong>RewardMe can utilize the full power of big data</strong>: using RewardMe, merchants can send a customized message only to customers that have purchased a salad and NOT a burger in the past 30 days. \u00a0Or, merchants can send a customized message only to customers that shop on the weekdays AND have bought a slice of pizza in the past 7 days.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>On the other hand, a merchant knows extremely little about their customers when they use Belly. \u00a0The only information that a merchant has about a customer is when and how often the customer comes in.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>They do collect the email address of every customer that signs up, but because belly has an extremely low sign-up rate, the merchant ultimately captures very few customer email addresses.</div>\n<h2>Ease of use</h2>\n<h3>Belly</h3>\n<p>Check out the video case study for a yogurt shop</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/36723815\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Process for tech-savvy customers</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download Belly App</li>\n<li>Open Belly App on phone</li>\n<li>Scan code on the iPad 2</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Process for non-tech-savvy customers</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Grab a Belly card</li>\n<li>Sign up card online</li>\n<li>Remember to bring the card with you every where that you go</li>\n<li>Scan card on the iPad 2 screen</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Process for merchants</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Promote Belly to its customers</li>\n<li>Call Belly when they run out of Belly Cards to replenish cards</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>RewardMe</h3>\n<p>Check out our video case study for a yogurt shop</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/41572443\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Process for ALL customers</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Punch in mobile number on the iPad screen</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Process for merchants</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Promote their own branded rewards program (watch how in the video, Fraiche promotes the Fraiche Rewards Program and not RewardMe)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>RewardMe is easy for ALL customers to use &#8211; no phone, no mobile apps to download, no QR codes to scan. \u00a0Every customer is accustomed to punching in their mobile number at the grocery store during checkout. \u00a0Because they&#8217;re already accustomed to this behavior, it&#8217;s extremely easy for every customer to sign up to RewardMe. \u00a0<strong>This is why we have 20.2% sign-up conversion rate for customers</strong>.</p>\n<p>Belly on the other hand is cumbersome to use. \u00a0Customers must download a mobile app in the store (often while in line), open the app, and scan it on the iPad 2. \u00a0If the customer isn&#8217;t tech savvy, then they have to carry around another loyalty card, which completely defeats the purpose of using technology to eliminate the need to carry around a loyalty card.</p>\n<p>The proof is in the numbers. \u00a0RewardMe is easy to use while Belly is a hassle to use &#8211; <strong>that is why we sign up 31x more customers per location than Belly</strong>.</p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Belly is a technology company <strong>focused on providing consumers with a universal rewards program</strong>. \u00a0To satisfy consumers, Belly signs up merchants to their rewards program. \u00a0In this way, a consumer is signing up for\u00a0Belly\u00a0specifically as opposed to a\u00a0<em>merchant&#8217;s branded rewards program</em>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, RewardMe is a technology company <strong>focused on providing merchants with a platform to better understand and engage with customers</strong>. \u00a0To satisfy merchants, RewardMe makes it very easy for merchants to sign up customers into their rewards program. \u00a0This is why our solution is customized to fit the merchant&#8217;s brand.</p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>I look forward to hearing your thoughts about the comparison and to receiving a reply from the Belly team.</p>\n",

Determine the type of loyalty program</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781\" title=\"benefit-from-rewards-program\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/benefit-from-rewards-program.png?resize=500%2C294&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"294\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>The following types of businesses require a frequency or point-based loyalty program to stay competitive and to retain their best customers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Retail stores</li>\n<li>Restaurants</li>\n<li>Travel companies</li>\n<li>Salons or spas</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In contrast, service-based businesses with customers that visit on an infrequent basis such as mechanics, lawyers, or accountants will benefit from a variation of the standard loyalty program. \u00a0These service-based businesses will benefit from a rewards program that drives customer referrals via word-of-mouth and word-of-click marketing.</p>\n<p>Answer the following questions before you build your loyalty program:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the average order value of your best customers?</li>\n<li>How often do your best customers return?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In general, your best customers compose the top 10% of your business. \u00a0These top customers are worth an estimated 5 &#8211; 6 times more than the other 90% of your customers.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788\" title=\"rewards-programs-statistic\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/rewards-programs-statistic.png?resize=500%2C218&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"218\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Therefore, when building your loyalty program, design it for your best customers.</p>\n<h2>2. Create rewards that drive the best behavior</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782\" title=\"control-the-brain\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/control-the-brain.png?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Rewards must drive a positive action. \u00a0For example, if you want to increase average order value, then offer a complimentary cookie with the\u00a0purchase\u00a0of any full meal combo. \u00a0If you want to drive signups to your email list, then offer a free upgrade on a drink today for joining your email list program.</p>\n<p>Here are the three universal principles that you should follow when creating rewards:</p>\n<h3>Expand beyond discounting</h3>\n<p>Discounts lower the quality of the brand and also teach the customer that the item they&#8217;re purchasing is worth less than full price. \u00a0Instead of discounting, add a bonus to a purchase. \u00a0For example, &#8220;Spend $10 and upgrade your smoothie to a large for free.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Small, quick rewards rule</h3>\n<p>Too often, franchises and small business owners limit themselves to punch cards that offer the &#8220;Buy 9 get 1 free&#8221; reward&#8221;. \u00a0These types of rewards are proven to NOT drive customer action because the rewards take too long to get redeemed. \u00a0What has proven to drive customer and user action are small, quick rewards that can be redeemed by the 2nd or 3rd visit. \u00a0Therefore, instead of offering a free burger after 9 visits, offer a free small french fries after 2 visits.</p>\n<h3>Generosity and recognition are key</h3>\n<p>Your best customers not only spend the most at your business, but they also tell their friends and family to shop at your business. \u00a0It is therefore in your best interest to make your best customers feel special and recognized. \u00a0A great way to do this is to encourage and support their word-of-mouth efforts. \u00a0A great example is the creation of a referral program: invite 5 friends and get a free smoothie. \u00a0You&#8217;ll see an increase in new clientele because customers will be motivated to tell everyone about your business.</p>\n<h2>3. Maximize customer acquisition</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783\" title=\"acquire-customer-info\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/acquire-customer-info.png?resize=429%2C315&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"429\" height=\"315\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Your employees are by far the most effective part of getting customers to join your rewards program. \u00a0Unfortunately, employees are very forgetful and will NOT tell every single customer to join your rewards program. \u00a0It is therefore of vital importance that the opt-in process of your loyalty program is cashier independent.</p>\n<p>At a high-traffic store, fast line speed is critical, and your rewards program needs to be fast and efficient to accommodate the needs of your customers.</p>\n<p>The following are essentials to optimize customer acquisition:</p>\n<h3>Fast sign-up process</h3>\n<p>Punch cards are fast, but insecure and easily cheated. \u00a0Loyalty cards capture customer information, but take the customer 2 minutes to sign up. \u00a0A customer will not fill out a form when there is a long line of customers waiting to get in their order.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Customer-autonomous sign-up tied to the customer&#8217;s mobile number. \u00a0It takes a couple seconds for a customer to type in their phone number while in line to join your rewards program. \u00a0RewardMe utilizes an iPad tablet at the point of sale to capture the customer&#8217;s mobile number and ensure line speed remains fast.</p>\n<h3>Easy management for rewards</h3>\n<p>Loyalty cards allow the customer to earn points; however, it does not offer an easy to use platform for customers to manage their rewards and find out how close they are to a reward. \u00a0After all, the closer you are to a reward, the harder you&#8217;ll work to achieve it.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Utilize a universal platform that allows customers to manage their points and rewards online on a mobile device. \u00a0RewardMe acts as a universal shopping identity, so customers can manage all of their points and rewards from a single location.</p>\n<h3>Sign up reward</h3>\n<p>The majority of your customers are lazy; they don&#8217;t want to fill out a form, they don&#8217;t want to give out their information &#8211; all they want to do is move on and eat their food. \u00a0It is difficult to acquire these people into your rewards program because they don&#8217;t feel an immediate need.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Create a 1-time immediate reward that customers receive for joining your rewards program. \u00a0If you&#8217;re a pizza spot, then the immediate reward can be a 3-topping pizza for the price of a 1-topping pizza. \u00a0If you&#8217;re a retail store, the immediate reward can be 10% off your entire purchase today. \u00a0RewardMe has a robust rewards tool that allows you to customize rewards to suit your needs.</p>\n<h2>4. Drive customer behavior through data personalization</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784\" title=\"drive-customer-behavior\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/drive-customer-behavior.png?resize=500%2C284&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>The most important part of a loyalty program is the ability to capture vital customer data and assign the data to an individual. \u00a0You need to know which of your customers come in during lunch, which of your customers have spent more than $200 in the past month, and which of your customers absolutely love your salads. \u00a0Without this important data, you won&#8217;t know how to drive customer behavior.</p>\n<h3>Personalization of messages</h3>\n<p>By collecting a customer&#8217;s email and phone number, you can set them up for email or text-message marketing campaigns. \u00a0Furthermore, if you couple this with the information you gather about the customer through a rewards program &#8211; information such as purchase patterns and behavior &#8211; then you can send targeted messages specifically tailored to the customer.</p>\n<p>For example, if a customer has bought 5 sandwiches at your business, then you can send them a text message on Wednesday afternoon that says, &#8220;Invite a friend! Buy 1 sandwich and get 1 free!&#8221; \u00a0The goal here is to drive a loyal customer to invite a friend and get them to love your business as well.</p>\n<h3>Cross-promote and up-sell</h3>\n<p>You can take this to the next level by offering cross-promotions and up-sells through the data you collect. \u00a0For example, if a customer is purchasing a pair of shoes, then immediately offer them a pair of socks or jeans that compliment the shoes. \u00a0The RewardMe tablet is an excellent way to visually up-sell at the point of sale and get a customer&#8217;s average order value higher, or make sure that he returns soon to buy the complimentary items.</p>\n<p>You can even sweeten the deal and make your best customers feel extra special &#8211; offer a time-sensitive deal on the purchase of a package of items:</p>\n<blockquote><p>These shoes would go great with a pair of jeans from our boot-cut section. Purchase any pair of jeans now with your shoes and get 5$ of your purchase today.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>These techniques are your guide to help you get started with your rewards program. \u00a0If you have any questions, make sure to ask us in the comments section below.</p>\n",

Nominated by readers,\u00a0 and voted on factors like innovation and growth, the Top 100 list provides a learning opportunity for restaurant owners all around.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Get Social. Grow Your Brand.</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-750\" title=\"Smashburger\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Smashburger.png?resize=500%2C227&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Smashburger\" width=\"500\" height=\"227\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>If there is one common denominator that is present in all of the fast casual restaurants mentioned on the Top 100 Movers and Shakers list, it&#8217;s the importance that social media plays in regards to brand building and brand awareness.<!--more--></p>\n<p><a title=\"Smashburger Website\" href=\"http://www.smashburger.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smashburger</a>, an innovative restaurant concept that allows burger aficionados to create their own &#8216;masterpieces,&#8217; boasts a robust community of fans on Facebook that it interacts and engages with on a daily basis. Like a megaphone, Smashburger has weaved their digital presence to be part of their overarching communication with fans by providing an avenue for customers to voice their love of their food as well as forum for feedback on new products.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Whether you are a small restaurant just starting out or a large, multi-unit corporate franchise, social media and the role it plays is only getting bigger. As a restauranteur, it is important to consider the advantages of building a presence in this space. Remember, it&#8217;s not just about telling fans you have a Facebook page or Twitter account. It&#8217;s about staying engaged and providing consistent value for your &#8216;fans&#8217; and community.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Innovate within</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-753\" title=\"WingStop Sports\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WingStop-Sports.png?resize=500%2C296&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WingStop Sports\" width=\"500\" height=\"296\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>A word that you often hear in the restaurant and fast casual industry is &#8220;innovation.&#8221; From innovating the items on your menu to the way you market your specials, innovation can play a big part in the long-term success of a business. &#8220;Wing Experts,&#8221; <a title=\"Wingstop website\" href=\"http://wingstop.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wingstop</a> is an excellent example of this.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Wingstop combined the two things that people love, wings and sports, to create the first ever <a title=\"Wingstop Sports\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150463230409674.383780.84579814673&amp;type=3\" target=\"_blank\">Wingstop Sports</a>. Featuring an expanded fast-casual menu and, for the first time, grilled items, Wingstop sports was the first &#8216;sports&#8217; themed location amongst their 500+ locations nationally. Conceptualized for the typical &#8216;sports fan,&#8217; Wingstop innovated within their brand by building an environment that would cater and enhance the sports fans experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Innovation doesn&#8217;t always mean revamping your menu or changing the way you market yourself. Like Wingstop, sometimes it can be in the experiences that we create for our customers. Another example of a brand that is innovating within is Burger King.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Diversify your service</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-749\" title=\"Habit Burger Truck\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Habit-Burger-Truck.png?resize=500%2C196&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Habit Burger Truck\" width=\"500\" height=\"196\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Another trend that the top 100 list shares is in the diversity of services that they provide. From offering some locations with full-service express lines for the &#8216;on-the-go&#8217; customer to building out custom locations for specific settings (ie: mall vs. theater), the &#8216;typical&#8217; restaurant is no longer typical.</p>\n<p>One example of this is <a title=\"Habit Burger website\" href=\"http://www.habitburger.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Habit Burger</a>. Featuring a menu that makes food lovers smile, The Habit is beyond just a burger joint. In addition to having more than 50+ units, The Habit also has it&#8217;s own, state-of-the-art food truck which caters events and parties for 100-500 people. Serving their famous <a title=\"Habit Burger Charbuger\" href=\"http://www.habitburger.com/charburger/\" target=\"_blank\">Charburger</a>, fries and a drink starting at less than $8 a person, <a title=\"Habit Burger Truck\" href=\"http://www.habitburger.com/hitting-the-road/\" target=\"_blank\">The Habit Truck</a> brings the full mobile food truck experience directly to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> When the time is right, consider offering services such as event and party catering. These can be excellent opportunities for your restaurant to expand it&#8217;s reach as well as bring in additional revenue.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Smart menu leads to smart business</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-751\" title=\"Corner Bakery Healthy Menu\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Corner-Bakery-Healthy-Menu.png?resize=500%2C212&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Corner Bakery Healthy Menu\" width=\"500\" height=\"212\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>The average consumer is no longer blind when it comes to putting food in their mouth. With a growing trend toward health consciousness, brands that make the effort to provide healthy food alternatives can find themselves with a customer base that is healthy and happy.</p>\n<p>Some brands that have made the transition toward offering additional items on their menu that promote healthy choice options include <a title=\"Corner Bakery Cafe website\" href=\"http://www.cornerbakerycafe.com/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Corner Bakery Cafe </a>which recently launched a new <a title=\"Corner Bakery Healty Food options\" href=\"http://www.cornerbakerycafe.com/cornercombos.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">calorie-conscious menu option</a>, that boasts more than &#8220;100 Corner Combos under 600 calories,&#8221; as well as McDonald&#8217;s which over the past 2 years has revamped their menu by adding items like apple slices and salads.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Adding healthy food choices to your current menu doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you are increasing your costs. Remember that many of the food items that would be categorized as &#8216;healthy&#8217; simply require an adjustment to the portion being served or a substitute of an ingredient.

Click here</strong>&#8220;. \u00a0This phrase drives an action because it directly targets a group of users: first-timers.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, check out what you see when you go to the Welcome tab:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-712\" title=\"carls-jr-welcome-tab\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/carls-jr-welcome-tab.png?resize=500%2C590&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"590\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>A first time user gets bombarded with a bunch of different calls to action. \u00a0Because there are so many different options, this creates decision paralysis and a first time user has no idea where to go.</p>\n<p>Instead of bombarding a user with choices, a Welcome page should have 1 call to action: <strong>why you should like this page</strong>.</p>\n<p>The goal of a Facebook page is to get the &#8220;like&#8221;. \u00a0Give the user a reason to like the page and you&#8217;ll increase your conversion rate.</p>\n<h3>The Photos App</h3>\n<p>The photos app is available by default and is one of the most commonly used apps for good reason. \u00a0Check out how Starbucks cleverly uses their albums to connect with users:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/starbucks-facebook-albums.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-713\" title=\"starbucks-facebook-albums\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/starbucks-facebook-albums.png?resize=500%2C283&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"283\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>I understand that you do not throw as many events and get togethers as Starbucks does, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t get creative. \u00a0Here are some ideas for photo albums for your local\u00a0business:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Our valued customers</strong>: photo album of your customers</li>\n<li><strong>Customer of the week</strong>: photo album with a customer that won something special that week</li>\n<li><strong>Charity events</strong>: if you hold charity events, this is a great place to put up your photos</li>\n<li><strong>Spring collection</strong>: if you&#8217;re a retail store, you can put up an album of each season&#8217;s collection</li>\n<li><strong>Menu items</strong>: if you&#8217;re a restaurant, you can put up an album of all your food</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sign up to newsletter app</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s always useful to get people to sign-up to your newsletter. \u00a0Free People utilizes their Sign Up app to get people to sign up for their email newsletter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-714\" title=\"free-people-facebook-timeline\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/free-people-facebook-timeline.png?resize=500%2C295&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"295\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-715\" title=\"free-people-sign-up\"

/></p>\n<h3>Events App</h3>\n<p>The events app is a great way to let your Facebook fans know about all of your upcoming events. \u00a0If you have a live band play at your location every week, or you&#8217;re hosting a friends and family discount day for your new season&#8217;s collection, then creating the event via the apps page lets fans join your event and keep up to date with updates.</p>\n<p>If you own a restaurant, then you can use the events app to let your customers know when you&#8217;re launching a new item on the menu. \u00a0The first 1,000 people to join the event

As Facebook continues to grow and improve the way that users are served content, EdgeRank is something that all marketers and businesses should be aware of.</p>\n<p>Playing a central role in the Facebook user experience, EdgeRank determines what items and stories are to be populated on an individual users News Feed. Specifically, each story is assigned a value which takes into account three known factors: Affinity, Weight, and Time</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Affinity:</strong> the relationship between the user and the updates origin page and or/friend whose update it is.<!--more--></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Weight:</strong> influenced by what category the story falls under. Example: a photo that is uploaded to a Facebook fan page vs. a comment on a person&#8217;s status. As stated in the infographic below, activities that require higher levels of user engagement tend to get a higher score than those that don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Time:</strong> how recent the update/action occurred.</p>\n<p>Understanding the concept of EdgeRank is fundamental for a business when considering the following: As a result of EdgeRank, a business/brand that has a <a title=\"Facebook Marketing Techniques\" href=\"http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/04/24/9-facebook-marketing-tactics-thatll-triple-your-fans/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook fan page</a> is more likely to hit <strong>new users rather than hit the same users</strong> with Facebook updates over time. In other words, EdgeRank prevents the same user from seeing updates from a Facebook page if it deems it to be a poor relationship between the two, thus allowing the brand to find new users who may be more inclined to interact with them.</p>\n<p>Check out this infographic below on more information on Facebook EdgeRank and how you can improve on EdgeRank:</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\">\n<dl class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 481px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Facebook-EdgeRank-Infographic.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-692 \" title=\"Infographic- Facebook EdgeRank and Why You Should Know About It\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Infographic-Facebook-EdgeRank-and-Why-You-Should-Know-About-It.png?resize=471%2C537&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"471\" height=\"537\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></dt>\n</dl>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-dd\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Facebook EdgeRank Infographic\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Facebook-EdgeRank-Infographic.png\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Click to Enlarge</strong></a></p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8212;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do you use Facebook to promote your brand?

However, menu prices can be the downfall of many businesses. Typically the number one factor in deciding where to eat out, menu prices can be the determinant between success and failure.</p>\n<p>As a restaurant business owner, there are many different approaches to figuring out how to price the items on a menu. From simply taking the food cost and multiplying it by 3 to estimating how much you think it&#8217;s worth, like tying your shoes, there are many different ways to approach it.</p>\n<p>Before jumping into writing in prices, consider the following factors when determining the &#8216;perfect&#8217; price for your menu items.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h2><strong>Factors That Affect Pricing</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Direct Costs: The things that go into the dishes.</strong></p>\n<p>The most obvious factor that influences the pricing of items on a menu are the ingredients. What we would consider direct costs, restaurant owners need to factor in every aspect of the ingredients that go into their dishes such as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Portion</strong>: As a rule of thumb, <a title=\"Food Portions in Pictures\" href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/healthy-eating/10-ways-to-measure-perfect-portion-sizes/pictures/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">portions</a> should be consistent. By doing so, you will know exactly how much, dollar wise, you are spending each time on ingredients.</li>\n<li><strong>Seasonal</strong>: Are the<a title=\"Seasonal Ingredients Guide\" href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/seasonalingredientmap\" target=\"_blank\"> ingredients seasonal</a>? Remember that seasonal food (ie: lobster) will create a fluctuation in your costs since their pricing is variable at different times of the year. If your dishes include seasonal ingredients, consider offsetting them by including items that are readily available year around so that you can create a base cost to factor from.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Indirect Costs: The things that aren&#8217;t food.</strong></p>\n<p>Second to the ingredients, are the &#8216;intangible&#8217; factors. These would include items like the <a title=\"Food Costs\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/weekinreview/24food.html\" target=\"_blank\">cost to prepare the food</a>.</p>\n<p>When factoring in the indirect costs of an item on your menu, consider the following factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Time</strong>: Every dish takes X amount of time to prepare. Just how a mechanic will charge you more for jobs that take longer to complete, the same is the case with food.</li>\n<li><strong>Serving</strong>: While most dishes must be prepared for each individual customers preference, such as steak, some items can be made to serve more than one group which may lower the cost. The best example of this is soup.</li>\n<li><strong>Overhead</strong>: While not a huge factor in the individual menu prices, a restaurants decor and setting may be a justification for charging higher prices.</li>\n<li><strong>Service</strong>: Whether you are a fast food restaurant or a fine dining restaurant, customers will come to expect a certain level of service and subsequently an expected level of pricing. A fast food restaurant would be doing themselves a dis-service of pricing themselves like a fine dining restaurant and vice versa.</li>\n<li><strong>Competition</strong>: Agood business owner will always look at their competition to see how their pricing compares. A good strategy is to use your competition as an indicator of how your own menu will fare. Don&#8217;t be afraid to even dine at your competitors to see what ingredients they use as well as to test out the quality of their menu items.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Restaurant Menu Pricing Methods</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Pricing-Food.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-659 aligncenter\" title=\"Pricing Food\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Pricing-Food.jpg?resize=500%2C173&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pricing Food\" width=\"500\" height=\"173\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now that you have considered the above factors for pricing your menu, the next step is to determine the method by which you will come up with your menu pricing.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>1. Cost Plus Pricing or Ideal Food Cost Model</strong></span></p>\n<p>The first method, and one of the more popular methods is to use a <strong>cost plus pricing or ideal food cost model</strong>. Using the actual cost of a menu item (direct + indirect costs), the restaurant owner will then determine what their ideal food cost percentage would be.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dish A cost $4.00 to prepare (direct + indirect costs)</li>\n<li>Owner of restaurant A determines ideal food cost percentage = 30%</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Result: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Minimum</span> menu price = $4.00 / 30% = $13.33</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>2. Ideal Food Cost Model + Competition Factor</strong></span></p>\n<p>Using a combination of the fore mentioned ideal food cost model and competition pricing, a restaurant can come up with menu item prices that will allow them to be both competitive and profitable.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dish A cost $4.00 to prepare (direct + indirect costs)</li>\n<li>Owner of restaurant A determines ideal food cost percentage = 30%</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum menu price = $4.00 / 30% = $13.33</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Competition pricing for similar dish = $16.00</li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Result: Dish B must be priced <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">between</span> $13.33 and $16.00</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>3. The &#8220;What I Think It&#8217;s Worth&#8221; Model</strong></span></p>\n<p>The 3rd method that we will mention here, and perhaps the most dangerous method is the &#8220;my way&#8221; method. As the title suggests, the &#8220;my way&#8221; method involves creating menu item prices based on what you think it&#8217;s worth. Whether it&#8217;s from things you have seen or your opinion of how much you think someone may be willing to pay for something, we suggest avoiding this method as it comes with too much uncertainty and may also overlook key factors such as food and labor costs.</p>\n<h2><strong>How To Increase Profitability</strong></h2>\n<p>Once you have figured out the magic number for each of the items on your menu, the next question on your mind may be how to increase profitability.</p>\n<p>Here are some tips that you can consider trying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Demand:</strong> Depending on where your business is located, you may be able to charge a &#8216;premium&#8217; in what can be considered a classic example of supply and demand. An example of this is with restaurant/coffee shops located within an airport. <em>Note: This tip/strategy will not work for all as not every business is in this specific situation.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Gradual Price Increase:</strong> If you are looking to raise prices on your menu items, raise them in small steps. In most instances, customers will not notice it and will assume that nothing has changed.</li>\n<li><strong>Upselling:</strong> Upselling is a classic strategy that most businesses implement on a day to day basis. For a restaurant establishment, make sure that all your servers and employees are trained to make the appropriate item suggestions to go with a customers order.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhance &#8220;Normal&#8221;</strong>: If you look at the most popular restaurant chains, one key factor is that &#8216;normal&#8217; isn&#8217;t really normal. For example, a cheeseburger can be made &#8216;special&#8217; by adding a special house dressing or adding an extra ingredient making it more appealing an enticing. Think: Cheeseburger vs. Hickory Smoked Bacon Cheeseburger</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>Do you own your own restaurant? If so, which method do you use to price your menu items?

Keeping things simple means visitors to your site will be able to find what they are looking for the quickest.</li>\n<li><strong>Bad Content Structure.</strong> <span style=\"color: #333399;\">Quick tip</span> &#8211; Make sure that what you want people to read or take action on (<a title=\"How to optimize your email newsletter for social media\" href=\"http://mashable.com/2011/03/14/email-social-media-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">email newsletter</a>) is easy to find. Similar to the tip on improving a sites navigation, content should be easily available to a user. Having them &#8216;search&#8217; for something will decrease your conversion and retention rates.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Frequency.</strong> <span style=\"color: #333399;\">Quick tip</span> &#8211; A great &#8216;looking&#8217; website is a start. Be sure to give users a reason to come back to your website by regularly updating it.

making it very important for businesses to stay up to date to maximize social engagement.</p>\n<p>In this post we will cover optimization for the cover image. \u00a0In future posts we will come everything from Facebook apps to utilizing sticky posts to drive awareness.</p>\n<p><strong>Who should read this post</strong>: business owners that are looking to improve the quality of their brand on Facebook</p>\n<p><strong>What you will learn</strong>: absolutely everything about optimizing the cover image for the Facebook Timeline</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>First and foremost, take the time to read the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php\" target=\"_blank\">Timeline Guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re too lazy to read, don&#8217;t worry, we got you covered. \u00a0The most relevant section for you to read at this moment is this one:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Covers may not include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Price or purchase information, such as &#8220;40% off&#8221; or &#8220;Download it on socialmusic.com&#8221;;</li>\n<li>Contact information such as a website address, email, mailing address, or information that should go in your Page&#8217;s &#8220;About&#8221; section;</li>\n<li>References to Facebook features or actions, such as &#8220;Like&#8221; or &#8220;Share&#8221; or an arrow pointing from the cover photo to any of these features; or</li>\n<li>Calls to action, such as &#8220;Get it now&#8221; or &#8220;Tell your friends.&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is important because it greatly limits how you use your cover image. \u00a0You cannot use it for promotional purposes, nor can you use it to drive action. \u00a0This means that the <strong>core functionality of the cover image is to immerse the Facebook user into your brand</strong>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll get to the immersion part in a bit. \u00a0Next, lets talk about dimensions.</p>\n<h3>Facebook cover specs and dimensions</h3>\n<p>Facebook <a href=\"http://facebookcoversize.com/\" target=\"_blank\">timeline cover specs</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>851px wide</li>\n<li>315px tall</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Very, very strange dimensions, right?</p>\n<p>Because of this strange dimension, it makes it very difficult to use a regular digital camera photo. \u00a0Lets take a look at some examples of photos that just don&#8217;t come out right.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/quicklyusa\" target=\"_blank\">Quickly</a> cover image below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/quickly.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-492\" title=\"quickly\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/quickly.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can tell what they were trying to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show happy customers at the restaurant</li>\n<li>Capture a long line so that it demonstrates that Quickly is popular</li>\n<li>Demonstrate customers drinking to entice Facebook users to want a boba drink</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea was good, but the execution is poor. \u00a0Not only is the image inside the store too dim, but it&#8217;s highly crowded, making it difficult for the user to focus on just one element. \u00a0Furthermore, you can see how using a digital camera photo looks awkward &#8211; the image comes out very skinny, making it difficult to see what&#8217;s actually going on in the photo.</p>\n<h3>Get creative and use the resources available to you</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/FreePeopleSouthCoastPlaza\" target=\"_blank\">Free People South Coast Plaza</a> is an example of the right idea but with average execution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/free-people-south-coast.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-493\" title=\"free-people-south-coast\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/free-people-south-coast.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Though the image is taken from a digital camera, the photographer was able to capture a well-lit entrance, welcoming the user to the Facebook Page. \u00a0 The image of an entrance is decent at best. \u00a0Your Facebook Fans already know what your entrance looks like because they&#8217;ve been to your store. \u00a0Instead of the entrance, a far better image to display is an image <strong>capturing your in-store brand</strong>.</p>\n<p>I quickly made my own cover image for Free People South Coast Plaza utilizing the images that the employees have already uploaded to the Facebook Page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/free-people-cover-awesome.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-494\" title=\"free-people-cover-awesome\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/free-people-cover-awesome.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>I quickly made this in about 5 minutes using Photoshop. \u00a0I know I&#8217;m not the best designer in the world, but you can see from my revision how the store can welcome customers with an image of their in-store brand: friendly, fashionable employees that are here to help you with your shopping needs. \u00a0What better way to connect with your fans on Facebook than to empower your employees and to make them feel recognized on your Facebook Page.</p>\n<p>Free People might even consider taking pictures of customers inside of the store and requesting permission to post their image on Facebook. \u00a0They can then select the best images and recognize their customers on a collage on their Facebook Timeline Cover.</p>\n<h3>Make your fans crave your product</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a restaurant, then the cover image is a great place to make your customers crave your food.</p>\n<p>What NOT to do:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/oinkadoodlemoo\" target=\"_blank\">Oink a Doodle Moo</a> presents us with another awkward digital camera photo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/oinkadoodlemoo.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-495\" title=\"oinkadoodlemoo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/oinkadoodlemoo.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>I understand that they want to welcome you to their page with open arms, but a restaurant needs to show fans the food. \u00a0The food is the reason that customers love your restaurant in the first place, so show them an enticing photo.</p>\n<p>Which of the two images below makes you crave their yogurt:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/redmango.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-496\" title=\"redmango\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/redmango.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>or</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/yogurtland.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-497\" title=\"yogurtland\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/yogurtland.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/yogurtland\" target=\"_blank\">Yogurtland</a> effectively uses an image of a person thinking about their yogurt. \u00a0The Yogurtland image provokes a much more emotional response than the image that <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/redmango\" target=\"_blank\">Red Mango</a> uses.</p>\n<h3>My two favorite cover images for restaurants</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/elevation-burger.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-498\" title=\"elevation burger\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/elevation-burger.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/smash-burger.png?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-499\" title=\"smash burger\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/smash-burger.png?w=500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>These images are perfect:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Just look at the succulent burgers &#8211; it makes me want to go to an <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/elevationburgerftmyers\" target=\"_blank\">Elevation Burger</a> or <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/smashburger\" target=\"_blank\">Smash Burger</a> right now to eat the food</li>\n<li>Elevation Burger directly tells you what they&#8217;re about: 100% organic beef</li>\n<li>Smash Burger uses their cover image to promote their new burger</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a restaurant owner, then these are the images that you need to model.</p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Utilize the above techniques to create your perfect Facebook Timeline Cover. \u00a0Once you&#8217;ve created it, attach a link to your Facebook page in the comments section so that we can take a look and provide our feedback.</p>\n",

Its success not only rides on the popularity of its predecessor Diablo II, but also stems from the utilization of a great amount of smart game mechanics to <a title=\"Addicted Diablo 3 User\" href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2012/05/16/i-can-never-play-diablo-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">make users engaged and addicted.</a></p>\n<p>This article analyzes the techniques and game mechanics that Diablo III uses to achieve the status of Winning &amp; Addicting.</p>\n<h3><em>Basic Game Mechanics</em></h3>\n<p><strong>1) High Quality Graphics and Sound</strong></p>\n<p>This is required for most games, and Blizzard is one of the best at it. Unfortunately, we won&#8217;t be learning too much from this because Gamification only applies to gaming elements that are still there after you strip out all the graphics, sound, action and apply them to professional activities.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Leveling Up System</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Pretty basic too. Pretty much all RPGs (Role Playing Games) have a leveling up system. When a player kills monsters, he gains Experience, which allows his character to level up and become stronger. A leveling system makes players feel that they are having progress and are improving themselves, even though the tasks they do are very mundane. A sense of improvement and accomplishment is key here.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Progression through a storyline</strong></p>\n<p>Again, like all RPGs, there is a storyline that makes players want to continue to play and find out what&#8217;s next. This is similar to wanting to finish a book or movie. Unfortunately, Diablo III&#8217;s storyline isn&#8217;t that great, and it makes you <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Diablo-3-Review-Between-Heaven-Hell-42698.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">play through the same storyline in 4 different levels</a> to beat the game (not to mention &#8220;farming&#8221; the same area/quests over and over), so this factor is not strong in Diablo. It does, however, get first-timers to want to finish the level 1 difficulty once.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Points/Money Accumulation</strong></p>\n<div><!--more-->Besides leveling up, many games use the accumulation of points or currency to keep users actively engaged to it. While in Diablo 2, gold was useless, gold is extremely valuable in Diablo 3. Many players would log on everyday and play the game brainlessly just to accumulate more gold, and/or find very good gear that he could sell for more gold. This not only causes people to log on often (why waste hours on NOT accumulating more gold?), but makes it VERY hard to quit the game. After all, I worked hard to accumulate so many points/gold in this game&#8230;it would all be wasted if I quit now. I better leverage it to my advantage instead!</div>\n<p><strong> 5) Social Pressure and Companionship</strong></p>\n<div><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Diablo-Gamification-2.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2110\" style=\"border: 2px solid black;\" title=\"Diablo Gamification 2\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Diablo-Gamification-2.jpg?resize=500%2C330&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Diablo Gamification 2\" width=\"500\" height=\"330\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<div>\n<p>Like all online games now, Diablo III allows players to chat and play with their friends, as well as strangers on the same quest. This makes the game more engaging and interactive, and allows players to pressure their friends to play Diablo too. Adding &#8220;social&#8221; to websites is what really drove the Web 2.0 world, with companies like Youtube or Flickr being very successful just because of the social factors.</p>\n<p>Blizzard allows each player to see whenever their friends go online, as well as introduces a 1-click join to play with them. Oftentimes, when a player has played for a couple hours and is starting to get tired, he sees a good friend of his come online and decides to join this friend and play for another 2 hours. Interestingly, this creates some social pressure when someone wants to quit the game completely &#8211; it almost seems like you have decided to stop hanging out with your friends!</p>\n</div>\n<h3><em>Advanced Game Mechanics</em></h3>\n<p><strong>1) Milestone Unlocks</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Level-Up-Gamification.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2112\" style=\"border: 2px solid black;\" title=\"Level Up Gamification\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Level-Up-Gamification.jpg?resize=570%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Level Up Gamification\" width=\"570\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Level-Up-Gamification.jpg?w=570&amp;ssl=1 570w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Level-Up-Gamification.jpg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the most successful gaming mechanics within games is something I call the Milestone Unlocks. When people play games, they often set an internal stop time in the form of a milestone &#8211; &#8220;Let me beat this boss and then I&#8217;m done.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m close to leveling up, let me level up and I&#8217;ll stop.&#8221; What the Milestone Unlock does, is that it unlocks an exciting possibility that wasn&#8217;t there before once that milestone is hit.</p>\n<p>In Diablo III, whenever you level up you learn a new set of skills. These skills are awesome and generally help you kill monsters faster, with more style, or it would have made your earlier gameplay a lot easier. Once players level up (their &#8220;stop time&#8221;), they naturally want to see what these skills are, test them out a bit, test them out on stronger enemies, enjoy how powerful they are, and then realize they are so close to the next milestone that they might as well get there first. (This is when people plan to stop at 11PM but end up playing till 5AM in the morning). Another example would be, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to bed once I check the Auction House.&#8221; And then BOOM, this player gets an amazing weapon in the auction house and he HAS to test it on some monsters and fully absorb his new sense of superiority. He&#8217;ll likely be thinking about it in bed too.</p>\n<p>One of the most successful iPhone/iPad games, <a title=\"Plants Vs Zombie Addict\" href=\"http://jycmba.hubpages.com/hub/Confessions-of-a-Plants-vs-Zombies-Addict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plants Vs Zombies</a> (which I will cover in a later post), utilizes Milestone Unlocks to the extreme. When you complete each level, you will unlock a new Plant to help you defend against Zombies, AND oftentimes, that new plant is the exact plant that could make your life a lot easier on this stage you just beat! Of course you would want to start the next stage and try it out!</p>\n<p><strong>2) Mentorship, Competition, and Envy</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div>Diablo III has a system where mentorship and guidance relationships can be created easily. The system is designed so that if you are a higher level character, you can easily help lower level characters beat quests, level up, and get better gear quicker. Being a mentor makes you feel fulfilled and important, while being an apprentice makes you feel that you got the easy way into progressing faster over others.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>With such a system, there automatically arises some sense of competition and envy (even before PvP is introduced). When you struggle at a quest for weeks, and then see your friend easily bust through it like its nothing, you aspire to be like that one day. Diablo III also allows players to look at each other&#8217;s gear, and when you see the legendary gear that they have, you want to go back and do the farming grind again. Seeing someone else win the jackpot certainly makes you want to gamble just a little bit more.</div>\n<p><strong>3) Randomness and Reward Loops </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Random-Gamification1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2113\" style=\"border: 2px solid black;\" title=\"Random Gamification\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Random-Gamification1.jpg?resize=580%2C302&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Random Gamification\" width=\"580\" height=\"302\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Diablo 3 has a unique feature among RPG games &#8211; randomly generated maps and monsters. Every time you go to the same area or play the same quests, the experience is different. This allows continuous playing possible without adding more content.</p>\n<p>More importantly, whenever you kill monsters (especially tough ones), you get gears and items on the ground that is randomly generated. Gear is at the core of Diablo, and up until recently is the only way to become stronger and progress through the highest difficulty (called Inferno Mode) in Diablo 3 once you reach the max level of 60.</p>\n<p>People play the same quests in Diablo 3 over and over again (called &#8220;farming&#8221;) because they want to get better gear to make themselves strong enough for a higher difficulty. Technically, every few hours of game play should give players a good item that they could use or they could sell for a good price. That&#8217;s just enough to keep them motivated to play on.</p>\n<p>Gambling is the full essence of this game mechanic. You have 20-80 minutes of &#8220;okay, somewhat fun&#8221; experience, and then get a reward that makes you addicted and impatiently wait for the next reward to show up.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Empowerment of Creativity and Instant Feedback</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-Skill.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2117\" title=\"Gamification Skill\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-Skill.jpg?resize=520%2C400&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gamification Skill\" width=\"520\" height=\"400\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>I believe everyone is inherently creative, and desires to utilize that creativity. Unfortunately, not everyone&#8217;s life permits them to express that creativity regularly (you should try cooking).</p>\n<p>What Diablo 3 does very well is that it has 5 different character classes (such as Wizard or Barbarian), and each class has around 100 different skills. At any given time, a player can only choose 6 active skills and 3 passive skills, creating A LOT of combinations and what is referred to as &#8220;builds&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Each time you think up a new build, you need to find/buy the appropriate gear to maximize its effectiveness, which in itself could take some time in game play.</p>\n<p>The fulfilling factor is that every time you have a creative idea, you could test it out and get immediate feedback. There may be a quest that a player can&#8217;t beat. He then thinks up a better skill combination and then successfully overcomes it, just to hit the next group of monsters and lose again.</p>\n<p>This continuous process of solving problems, testing, improving and accomplishing is very fulfilling for each player, and it causes them to think about their strategies, research what others are doing through online forums, and analyze each move through Excel spreadsheets whenever they are NOT playing Diablo.</p>\n<p>The ability to get users to think about a game consistently and can&#8217;t wait to I back and test new things out is key to becoming a winning &amp; addicting game (and yes, there are a great amount of &#8220;spreadsheet gamers&#8221; that do math often and tries to optimize their combinations and winning percentages).</p>\n<h3>Mistakes in Diablo 3</h3>\n<p>No game is flawless, and Diablo 3 certainly has its fair share of mistakes (note: just because users are complaining or whining doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a game design mistake. Sometimes the frustration, such as boundaries and limitations, is part of what makes a game good).</p>\n<p>Diablo 3&#8217;s mistakes include:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Capped the development of a character</strong></p>\n<p>Until recently, a Diablo 3 player could reach Level 60 by killing monsters and obtaining experience. However, after Level 60, the only progress that could be found is in finding better gear and finding better creative builds.</p>\n<p>However, if a player plays for a few hours and <a href=\"http://comluv.com/a-quick-review-of-diablo-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">does not receive better gear</a>(again, it&#8217;s randomly generated), it could be seriously frustrating and could feel like a waste of time.</p>\n<p>Recently Diablo solved this issue by introducing Paragon Levels, a set of levels from 1-100 AFTER a player reaches level 60. With this, at least players will feel a continuous development in their characters even if everything else remains static. However, the continuous development of a character highlights the next mistakes:</p>\n<p><strong>2. Making the Game too easy</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-End-Diablo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2120\" title=\"Gamification End Diablo\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-End-Diablo.jpg?resize=614%2C346&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gamification End Diablo\" width=\"614\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-End-Diablo.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Gamification-End-Diablo.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>When I implied that Diablo 3 has limitless challenges, that&#8217;s only partially true. Due to user complaints (which again, isn&#8217;t necessarily bad), Blizzard has been drastically decreasing the difficulty of even the hardest levels, while making player skills much stronger (on top of paragon levels).</p>\n<p>This creates a problem as it eliminates the user&#8217;s desire to care. The only reason why you want to level up, get good gear, find better builds, is to be able to beat a more difficult level that you couldn&#8217;t earlier.</p>\n<p>Instead of having players &#8220;work&#8221; to accomplish the tasks, Blizzard opted to make the tasks easier, which could create a quick buzz of happy users initially (because now they could all resolve problems that were previously too difficult for them), but in the long run, users get used to this &#8220;easy game&#8221; and <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/blizzard-says-diablo-3s-inferno-mode-cant-sustain-long-term-play/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no longer have anything to fight for</a>. You can now beat the final boss with semi-good gear that wasn&#8217;t possible earlier. Now what? There are no more incentives to farm and get even better gear after this point.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Not having enough depth and size on each quest and map</strong></p>\n<p>Another big issue that Diablo 3 has, is that it has a relatively short storyline as well as smaller maps. In Diablo 2, a player could be playing for a much longer time and always feel lost in the big world with a huge variety of stages and places to explore. For Diablo 3, each act feels much smaller and quicker to finish. This quickly makes farming monotonous and eventually people feel tired of doing the same routine over and over again.</p>\n<p>As a quick fix, Blizzard could consider adding some &#8220;long mini-quests&#8221;, where on many maps, there would be a mini-quest that would take 1-2 hours to complete (basically one event leading to another). At this point, Blizzard simply adds tiny mini-quests that just involve one wave of monsters along with an elite, but doesn&#8217;t add too much variety to the game (they could possibly add a quest when you go into a dungeon and fight a Butcher and Siege Breaker at the same time &#8211; none of it new content.)</p>\n<h3>Applying Lessons from Diablo III for Business Gamification</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Diablo-in-Real-Life.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2121\" style=\"border: 2px solid black;\" title=\"Diablo in Real Life\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Diablo-in-Real-Life.jpg?resize=576%2C430&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Diablo in Real Life\" width=\"576\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Diablo-in-Real-Life.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Diablo-in-Real-Life.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Instead of just doing the regular &#8220;points&#8221; system and adding a leader board, there&#8217;s a lot more you could to your product and company culture to make it more interactive, fun, and challenging. Are you creating appropriate Milestone Unlocks to motivate people to continue? Are you introducing friendly competition and envy through a Peer/Mentorship Program? How about spiffying things up with some Randomness and a well managed Reward Loop Structure? And what do you do to inspire people&#8217;s creativity and sense of accomplishment?</p>\n<p>I would love to hear your examples of applying these principles into your work and your life.</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>Collecting and using data is a sensitive subject. \u00a0On one hand, you want to collect as much data as possible so that you can fully understand your customers and personalize marketing messages &#8211; the end goal being customer influence.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, leveraging what you know about a customer can be pretty creepy. \u00a0Remember the Target example &#8211; when Target knows a girl is pregnant before her father does. \u00a0Well, that&#8217;s an example of how a company can get to the <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/big-data-terrifying/233725/\" target=\"_blank\">creepy side</a>.</p>\n<p>Ultimately it&#8217;s about being transparent and respectful at all times, but don&#8217;t let it decrease your creativity. \u00a0Below are 5 ways in which you can capture and leverage big data, while maintaining your level of creepiness low.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>1. Make it very clear how your plan to use the data</h3>\n<p>First, cover your bases completely in your Terms of Use page and your Privacy Policy page. \u00a0It&#8217;s very important to make it clear (from the legal standpoint) about how you plan to use the data.</p>\n<p>Second of all, write a laman&#8217;s version of how you plan to use your data on a separate page on your site. \u00a0This can perhaps be in a blog post. \u00a0Let your customers know that you collect certain data so that you can better service them. \u00a0By being transparent and clear about how you plan to use the data, then customers will feel safer and more secure.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure to let them know that you&#8217;re NOT reselling their data.</p>\n<h3>2. Make the personalization feel casual</h3>\n<p>When you make personalization too personal, then customers start feeling a little weird and over exposed. \u00a0When Target initially sent out ads to women who were most likely pregnant, they specifically only sent out baby-related ads. \u00a0If a woman sees only baby-related products, she may feel a little strange and think, &#8220;how does Target know that I&#8217;m pregnant?&#8221; \u00a0She may feel like you&#8217;re trying to manipulate her.</p>\n<p>Target quickly realized their mistake and changed their advertisements. \u00a0They now send targeted ads alongside random ads. \u00a0For example, if they&#8217;re targeting a women who is likely pregnant, then they&#8217;ll send a baby-product ad next to a kitchen-appliance ad. \u00a0In this case, the woman doesn&#8217;t feel overexposed, but she still sees the baby-product advertisement.</p>\n<h3>3. Text message at most twice a month</h3>\n<p>Texts are a great way to directly reach a customer and cause action immediately. \u00a0A great example is to use text-message marketing to fill empty seats during a slow day at your restaurant.</p>\n<p>However, if you overuse text messages, then customers can quickly unsubscribe from your marketing messages and no longer trust your company. \u00a0For this reason, we recommend that you send at most 2 text messages per month to your customers. \u00a0In this way, customers don&#8217;t feel bombarded by messages from you, but you&#8217;re still able to impact customers and leverage a following multiple times a month.</p>\n<h3>4. Allow easy opt-outs</h3>\n<p>As a follow up to point #3, make sure to make it very easy for your customers to opt-out of your marketing, advertising, and loyalty programs. \u00a0Customers should be able to opt-out with a an easy click of the button.</p>\n<p>If they have to jump through hoops, call customer service, and go through a long, drawn out process to opt-out, then you may lose more than an email subscriber &#8211; you may lose a customer.</p>\n<h3>5. Give customers a reason to give you their data</h3>\n<p>The perfect example of this is to provide customers with a <a href=\"http://www.rewardme.com\" target=\"_blank\">rewards program</a>. \u00a0A customer joins a rewards program for one simple reason &#8211; to get free stuff. \u00a0In return, you get access to the customer&#8217;s valuable information &#8211; it&#8217;s a win-win scenario.</p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Focus on the above 5 points and you and your customers will build a long, healthy, and very personal relationship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Brands have new and exciting options to explore when updating, renovating, and refreshing their stores. This trend has picked up recently with various franchise categories from regional chains such as the overhaul of <a title=\"Daphne's Greek Cafe\" href=\"http://www.daphnesgreekcafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Daphne\u2019s California Greek</a> (formerly Daphne\u2019s Greek Caf\u00e9) to national chains such as Jack in The Box who is currently in the process of updating their logo, store d\u00e9cor, and overall image. Digital is seen as the future and forward-thinking concepts are looking to lead the way and reap the benefits of leveraging new technology. Digital signage, referring to menu boards, in-store kiosks, and point of purchase advertisement displays, are just a few examples of consumer-facing technology being deployed to drive sales and improve the in-store customer experience.</p>\n<h3><strong>Staying Competitive in the Face of Change</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite proof of measurable increases in revenue when properly leveraging new technologies, many franchisors and particularly their franchisees are off-put by anything different and resistant to change. The majority believe what has worked in the past, still works, and will continue to work. Even before understanding why trends are developing toward a more digital world, many are discounting new technologies, raising unfounded barriers, and ultimately doing themselves a disservice by not considering new technology a way to stay competitive and ahead of the curve. <!--more--></p>\n<p>Understandably, new technology has an upfront cost, whether it be hardware, software licensing, or most importantly staff training associated with switching to a new system. On the converse side, with forward-thinking companies adopting store improvements and technology implementations, can you afford to not stay ahead of the competition?</p>\n<h3><strong>Digital Signage and Customer Engagement</strong></h3>\n<p>Currently, the most popular uses of digital signage are as in-store menu boards or drive thru menu boards at QSR locations, but it has also popped up as standalone kiosks and as point of purchase displays. The digital signage \u2018revolution\u2019 offers customers a more interactive and engaging experience while delivering key value to franchises in the form of advertisements, potential up-sells, and cross promotions. These displays attract more of the customer\u2019s attention as it stands out from the rest of the static advertisements.</p>\n<p>Businesses also have the advantage to easily change menu items (ie: from breakfast to lunch) with the switch of a button or create a rotating display of advertisements to retain engagement and peaked interest. In order to outpace the competition, franchises need to realize the changing behaviors of their customers and connect with them through channels and mediums that are becoming more and more familiar &#8211; tactile forms of electronics and media.</p>\n",

        },
        "content": {
            "rendered": "<h3>Culture Management is essential for growth stage companies</h3>\n<p>Our company has been through many cycles and products throughout the years, but it&#8217;s the passion and bond between teammates that have always carried on with us. That will continue to carry on no matter what size we grow to. We are a team, and we are a family.</p>\n<p>This places an enormous emphasis on having the right Culture. Culture is something intangible but very impactful. <strong>It affects team morale, productivity, conflict resolution, decision-making, and hiring</strong> &#8212; basically everything that moves the company forward in the right direction. It is something that needs to be nurtured and maintained, as it could easily be diluted as the company grows.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I spent a lot of time researching about companies that boast their cultures as a competitive edge, including Apple, Zappos, Netflix, Yammer and more (yes, I\u2019m not pretending I came up with all this stuff. The giants get the credit and I get the shoulders). I also made a list on what most of my friends love about their jobs, and what they hate about their jobs to figure out how can we create a system that automatically generates the former and eliminates the latter.</p>\n<p>It seemed striking to me that, everyone complains about their managers, but when these complainers become managers themselves, nothing has changed, as people below them still complain about their managers. Clearly the \u201cbad manager\u201d syndrome is not based on an individual\u2019s capability, but an overall system flaw.</p>\n<p><strong>Culture is the system that either creates the right environment where everyone can easily be good managers, or where bad managers are kicked out, so good people do not lose motivation.</strong></p>\n<h2>A culture based on Gamification</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a certain DNA within the Octalysis Group Team Members that keeps us all bonded together. We call it a DNA because it isn&#8217;t just rules that look nice, but it should be something that is ingrained deep inside every member, which is reflected upon daily conduct.</p>\n<p>These are not just fancy statements we put on walls and badges, but all team member are evaluated (and rewarded) based on how well they have this ingrained into them. <strong>Hiring and firing should not only be based on performance output, but also environment output.</strong></p>\n<h3>1) Put positive energy into the company</h3>\n<p>Bad attitude in the company is UNACCEPTABLE. Your responsibility in the company is not only to perform, but to make everyone around you better in every way you can. Don&#8217;t be the &#8220;Game over man!&#8221; guy you see in movies. Be that person who is always thinking positively and encouraging others. Always inspire hope and ideas to new solutions.</p>\n<h3>2) In whatever you do, be exceptional and over-impressive</h3>\n<p>Our competitors are filled with good people. That&#8217;s why we all need to be excellent. We believe the best people are 10x compared to the average, and we should always strive to be that 10x. You need to care intensively about outperforming expectations and getting more wins together as a team.</p>\n<p>You need to maintain calm poise in stressful situations and be a strong pillar, especially when it takes many pillars to hold up a roof. We don&#8217;t care about being over-impressed with your hours. We want you to create WOW moments for the rest of the team. Do whatever it takes to achieve that.</p>\n<h3>3) Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit</h3>\n<p><!--more-->Hangout with each other, and make it easy to hang out with you. We&#8217;re not just working, we&#8217;re on a journey together. Spend time helping teammates even outside of work with personal matters. Share helpful information openly and proactively.</p>\n<p>Be Considerate and think from the other person&#8217;s angle. Say an extra sentence if it makes them feel better, but don&#8217;t take anything too personally yourself. Saying things like, &#8220;I understand your point. What I think differently on is&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Sorry about being so jumpy at you earlier&#8221; makes a world of difference. Celebrate personal and career wins TOGETHER as often as you can. In everything you do, make the Family better, but also remember: you are part of the family too, so take care of yourself.</p>\n<h3>4) Constantly show self-motivation, autonomy, and accountability</h3>\n<p>Be self-motivated and self-disciplined. Don&#8217;t wait to be told what to do, but be proactive like a leader. If you see trash on the floor, pick it up and throw it away. We don&#8217;t like to micromanage or be micromanaged, so behave in a way that is best for the team. Be clear on your responsibilities. If you are responsible for something, seek both expert and non-expert opinions, but let the expert decide &#8211; getting cross-department feedback is extremely important and necessary. When you need help, it is your responsibility to ask for help instead of other&#8217;s to wonder if you need help.</p>\n<p>Final decisions and accountability should belong to you and not by a committee/consensus. Clear responsibilities allow knowledge sharing but not decision sharing. People who thrive on freedom are worthy of freedom. When you notice your team lead is exerting constant supervision for your daily work, you should be a little worried &#8211; for yourself or for the team lead.</p>\n<h3>5) Always trust your teammates and always be trustworthy</h3>\n<p>Trust your colleagues &#8211; they&#8217;re here because they are smart, capable, and working towards the same goal as you. There should be no blame games in the company. No one is perfect, and we function like one body. Only seek to help your teammates, not blame them.\u00a0A body cannot be in competitive sports if the hands are always blaming the legs, and the legs are always blaming the eyes. If you blame others a lot, you also make it extremely awkward when it&#8217;s your turn to make a mistake, which is inevitable.</p>\n<p>When a mistake is made, regroup quickly, find the solution and start executing again. In your work, always make sure that your team can trust you with everything in your abilities. Be accountable to your mistakes and always seek help when you may not be able to hit your targets. Delegate with confidence.</p>\n<h3>6) Stay focused, but always be curious for new solutions and have the confidence to execute</h3>\n<p>With limited time and resources, we need to be focused and persistent. Stay on course but focus on the long run. In your work, always look for a better solutions to do things better, even if the problem isn&#8217;t directly in your area of expertise.</p>\n<p>Be Agile-minded. When you have a new solution, have the confidence to try it out. If being deviated will allow us to stay on course for the long run, do not be dogmatic and squeeze out room for flexibility and innovation. 5 years later, everything will be different and we ourselves can&#8217;t afford to always stay the same.</p>\n<h3>7) Don&#8217;t be afraid to create fun and a little goofiness</h3>\n<p>Endorse your own uniqueness and exert that into the company. We recognize and celebrate each person\u2019s individuality, and we want his/her true personality to shine in the workplace environment. Being at Octalysis Group is more like a LAN party than a soldier squad &#8211; you play the game intensively and seriously while pulling jokes on each other.</p>\n<p>We make work fun when we can, and having a little goofiness in the system helps alleviate stress, brings people closer, and makes it easier for teammates to collaborate/confront with you. Of course, there is a line you shouldn&#8217;t cross, but it&#8217;s a rather squiggly one.</p>\n<h3>8 ) Encourage dissent: Argue with respect. If you are right, listen as if you are wrong</h3>\n<p>Listen well, instead of reacting fast. Make it safe to provide and receive feedback. Safety means that when feedback is delivered, it won&#8217;t easily sink the productivity or effectiveness of the entire team. The team has the open-mindedness to listen to feedback, reflect upon it, and avoid letting it destroy their motivation and productivity. Feedback is not a demand for others to change. It is simply a way to have a conversation about behaviors and mindsets in a way that brings greater awareness of each other&#8217;s motivations and boundaries.</p>\n<p>Avoid the Tennis no-man&#8217;s land: The average of two strategies is usually not a strategy. Always remember that, despite our different opinions on how to do it, we all have the same goal &#8211; to make the company successful. So fighting internally is counterproductive to the mutual goal. Also, it&#8217;s more rewarding and profound when you thought incorrectly and adjusted your mindset, compared to just convincing people of your point.</p>\n<h3>9) Endorse our competitors as our best teachers</h3>\n<p>Competitors don&#8217;t kill startups. Indifferent customers do. Competitors are (potentially) smart teams and brains that are solving the same problems. We should take advantage of this external research lab, instead of feel threatened by it. The market is big enough for more than one player.</p>\n<p>We only need to focus on 2 things: close deals and deliver value. If a competitor can teach us some tips on how to do those 2 things better, they are good competitors. Sure, we want to beat them, but just in the same mentality that we want to beat friends in a sports game. Maintain sportsmanship.</p>\n<h3>10) Do the Right Thing</h3>\n<p>Doing the right thing is often hard, and can be uncomfortable to you and/or others. But it is also essential for the long-term health of the company. You should always question actions that are inconsistent with our values regardless of the position of the person you are questioning. You should be egoless when searching for the best ideas and be non-political when there are disagreements.</p>\n<p>Your actions and decisions should not be surprises to anyone &#8211; be candid and gently prepare people mentally for what you stand for. Be quick to admit to your mistakes. You are more easily forgiven if you take responsibility for your mistakes proactively. Be respectable and don&#8217;t do evil. Never harm our customers &#8211; actions are only acceptable if it will not degrade our customer&#8217;s current experience or harm their operations. If there are short-term pains to our customers, we need to be sure that the future gain will greatly exceed the initial inconvenience.</p>\n<h3>Anything in your company culture that is impactful?</h3>\n<p>If anything in your company culture has made it especially extraordinary and awesome, please share and discuss it here so we can work together to create better working environments for everyone!</p>\n",

It went by faster and slower than I expected. Slower because so many things happened in this year and we got so much done, and faster because it felt like an instant and there were still so much more that we wanted to do!</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>This is an email that shares a bit on the journey we took, what led us to where we are today, and why we are doing what we are doing. When our company becomes so big that employees no longer recognize the names of everyone in the company, there is something that everyone can trace back to and see what happened among the Founding Members that built the kingdom together through hard work, persistence, faith, and loyalty towards each other.<br />\nAnd this is the story that will be remembered as books and movies are made about us \ud83d\ude42</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Now that you are all excited and ready, here is the Life of\u00a0RewardMe\u00a0in 2011 (I omit some names for privacy and confidentiality considerations):</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>January 2011</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Having conceptualized the idea\u00a0RewardMe\u00a0and pivoted from Viralogy 3 months ago, we finally launched our first QR Code Phone app product. We raised about $50K in the past year and are fighting hard to spread our product everywhere and raise more funding.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>February 2011</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>We were quickly implemented in 50 stores in Mountain View and Palo Alto with our QR Code product. We got relatively few signups and check-ins (looking back) but we were all excited about it and a small base of iPhone/Android users loved us. We made the mistake of scaling up too quickly before making 100% sure there is product/market fit, especially with the merchants. It was also by impressive fate that Adam Gervin, an Entrepreneur with $1B in exits and now our dear teammate, saw\u00a0RewardMe\u00a0at the store that was actually classified as a &#8220;lost cause&#8221; between Jun and Me due to poor check-ins, and liked it enough to approach us about working together. Vincent Ng, our sales helper in Vancouver, also decided to invest his own money in the company to push us forward.</div>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>March 2011</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>We got our first 2000 check-ins! Adam also officially joined us. However, we were still tight on fundraising, especially after a particular investor giving us a blank check literally that got us into financial trouble. We pitched at many places and met with many investors, and most did the classic &#8220;show me more&#8221; or &#8220;come back later&#8221; stuff (and most of them regretted it heavily too&#8230;I&#8217;ve met a few of them \ud83d\ude09 )</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>April 2011</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Ashwin our intern joined us. Earlier he turned down a full-time offer from Goldman Sachs after graduating from Northwestern University, and became an Intern on our team. Now he is our designer and doing a great job. Ashwin&#8217;s first day here was our huge discussion on whether we should abandon our QR Code product and transition to a &#8220;tablet&#8221; solution that fulfills the same value proposition in a MUCH better way. This solution would allow 1. EVERYONE to take advantage of RewardMe, not just iPhone/Android users, and 2. Stores to reward people based on order value instead of frequency. It would also open a whole world of Online-to-Offline to our platform. Excitingly, we raised $200K from Investor A and $20K Investor B, right when funding was getting really tight.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>May 2011</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>We went to our first customer conference, the Multi-Unit Franchise Conference in Las Vegas! With our Chief Product Officer Steve&#8217;s demo with Brand A, we attracted many franchise brands, including Brand B and Brand C, with one being fully deployed with us right now and the other in deep discussions. We also officially moved in our new office, which was actually a 4-bedroom house that the team worked out of. It was an amazing upgrade from our subleased small office and the 2 Bedroom we worked out of and made the team extremely productive and working together. We also reiceived another investors&#8217; $200K, as well as met with eventual investors like TeleNav, Auqeo, Investor C, and Investor D.\u00a0Also, Patrick officially joins\u00a0RewardMe\u00a0and starts working on\u00a0my.rewardme.com (now just regular RewardMe.com), and Gerald Fong (intern) joins us part-time and starts to work on Freshbook invoicing.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>June 2011</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Justin Warmkessel, a developer that worked out of the other startup that we were subleasing from, officially left that startup and joined us! We now have a pretty complete Dev team to pump out a bunch of new features! We also won 1st place at the AlwaysOn OnMobile conference, eventually giving us the title of &#8220;Top 10 Private Companies to Watch in 2011&#8221;. At this point we started to work with a product designer from Taiwan to create our customer stands. We also started to work with POS Hero to see how powerful our product can be when it is fully integrated. Also Investor C puts in $25K.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>July 2011</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Our team did a Root Beer Float + Worse Movie Competition Night, which was the best and agonizing night of our lives. We pitched many more franchises, including Brand D and Brand E. TeleNav gets onboard as an $250K investor, as well as received another $50K from Investor D. At this point, we started working on Cohiba the cigar shop in Santanna Row and completed our Data Warehouse and lossless communication within our product.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>August 2011</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>We launched the first tablet product at Cohiba with full POS Hero integration! We also made a connection to Brand F, which introduced us to Brand G (the 5th largest theater chain in the US), and had our first meeting with a Brand H, which is a national chain and a public company. We received our first batch of triangle stands from the designer in Taiwan, which is the ones we used for Brand A. Two more investors also joined in the company with $80K, one of which had deep connections into our customer space! At this time, we completed our patent-pending technology that allows us to have a tremendous edge, shrinking a process of 10-20 months to just a few hours. Sadly, our intern Gerald started school and leaves the company \ud83d\ude41</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>September 2011</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Our Oaklahoma developer Patrick came to work locally in California for 3 weeks! Brand A, #1 in Fast Casuals &#8220;Top 100 Movers and Shakers&#8221;, decided to move forward with us. We also finished the Brand G Demo, which they liked a lot. This month we were mostly busy working on Brand A and settling stability issues with Cohiba.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>October 2012</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>First Brand A locations setup (as well as a Quickly store)! Our product showed amazing numbers and we prove to achieve product market fit. After a few days of piloting, Brand A wanted us to implement at ALL their locations. Brand C signed a 5-year contract with all their locations too! We also got our meeting with the national coffee chain Brand H. Both Brand B and G wanted to move forward. We became a Top 3 Finalist as Best Commercial App at the first LBS Awards called The Locals. October was a very good month with flying colors.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>November 2012</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>All our Brand A locations got implemented! Brand I the Frozen Yogurt store also signed. We also met with a few VC firms and a potential acquirer. We Moved forward with other locations, especially Brand G and Brand I. Brand H gave us a soft commitment to do a pilot. This month was mainly on making our product more stable for all the Brand A Locations, including the support work involved. Our product became a ton better and we created more systems.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>December 2012</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>We recruited 3 more interns into the company! Arica, Raj, and Shine. We moved forward with Brand G and especially and a sub-brand. We streamlined our implementation, support, and product stability, and added many more useful functionalities. Now we have a ton of users/check-ins everyday (20% of a store&#8217;s daily customers are checking into RewardMe). We also have many investors and customers setup for Q1 of 2012.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2012 and beyond!</strong></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>As you can see, we&#8217;ve done so much in 2011. I believe we will accomplish exponentially more in 2012. We no longer need to pivot. We&#8217;ve done most of the preparation, trial &amp; error, and foundational work. 2012 is the year where we take that\u00a0foundation\u00a0and grow. It&#8217;s the time to make that mark in the industry and finally bring online services into the store.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>I&#8217;m blessed to have such a great team, and I&#8217;m excited to work with everyone to create legacy together.</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Happy 2012!!</div>\n",

I then realize it\u2019s something that may be worth sharing about.</p>\n<p>Often times, when I ask these startup CEOs about their roles in the company, they would sheepishly say, \u201cYea\u2026so I\u2019m the \u2018CEO\u2019 of the company\u2026.whatever that really means\u2026\u201d I\u2019ve been in that mentality myself. It\u2019s hard to explain what you do as a startup CEO, as everything seems pretty vague and does not sound like it tangibly makes the business more value. The only clear task that people actually credit their CEOs is \u201cfundraising\u201d.</p>\n<p>But these CEOs unanimously say they work crazy hours. So what are they doing anyway with these hours? It\u2019s somewhat of a mystery.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>The To-Do Waterfall</h3>\n<p>Many CEOs that I talk to have the same pain and complaint. A big part of emailing and meetings actually take up a lot of time, and it becomes hard to execute quickly on other tasks.\u00a0 When you start a company, there\u2019s actually a lot more little coordination stuff internally and externally than most people expect. Many of them say that email answering sometimes occupy their entire day, leaving only off-hours to do anything else. \u00a0I\u2019ve had the experience myself where every time I\u2019m on the plane for a few hours, 50-60 more emails that I all need to address pop up. \u00a0The rest of the day becomes catch-up and hopefully beating the new incoming emails.</p>\n<p>Even when I try to solve this problem by being briefer and respond to lower priority emails later, it sometimes results in people feeling that I don\u2019t respect their feelings and I have to spend more time mending the relationship. And prioritizing email answering doesn\u2019t help a lot, because eventually, you still need to take action on all of them, and they build up. Often times, I would set out the day wanting to accomplish 10 tasks, and then at the end of the day, I have 13 of those tasks remaining&#8230;</p>\n<h3>The Night in Shining Armor</h3>\n<p>During off-hours (late at night) where emails stop coming in, that\u2019s when a CEO can catch up with work. But even in those times, a lot of that effort is put into unexpected tasks like putting out fires, as well as being the emotional stronghold to all the teammates. As the CEO, you are the person that everyone goes to when they have complaints about each other, when they feel unsure about the business, or when they have this brilliant idea that you have to acknowledge before they take it too far. And trust me, these things come up A LOT in startup.</p>\n<h3>The Scarecrow that the Startup deserves, not the one it needs</h3>\n<p>And this is where the pain lies. After entire days of coordination and communications, the teammates ask, \u201cSo what is our CEO doing all day anyway? Is he even doing any work?\u201d\u00a0 Many Startup CEOs feel like they work super hard and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/30/pre-launch-startup-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">add a lot of value</a> to the business, but they\u2019re not appreciated much for their work.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve felt that frustration myself too. Someone would say, \u201cWell earlier I talked to Yu-kai about this pretty essential thing, but I have no clue what he\u2019s been doing besides that.\u201d What\u2019s not as obvious, is that if every member of the company had that \u201cessential\u201d hour conversation with the CEO, the day is pretty much over, not to mention the interaction with lawyers, accountants, and external meetings. And then there\u2019s all the stuff that needs to be filed to the government for having the right license, giving out stock, doing taxes.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Uberman </span>Everyman to the Rescue!</h3>\n<p>Interestingly, I adapted a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Polyphasic sleep\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep\">Polyphasic Sleep Schedule</a> where I would sleep 3 hours at night and take three 20-minute naps during the day. That worked out great for me, because during the day, I can do all the coordination work. And then between 11PM-5AM, I could focus on getting stuff done.</p>\n<p>This lasted for about 3 months, and I actually was able to get most of my stuff done, while having some time to rest and decompress on a game or movie, without falling behind on my tasks. But then ridiculously, I had so many meetings that needed to be booked, I could no longer take the naps during the day (even if I could sleep on the car). It\u2019s only the end of October, and my meetings are already being booked in late November and early December. As a result, I went off my sleep schedule for a few weeks now.</p>\n<p>I then was shocked upon the realization of how essential it was: with 6-7 hours of sleep, I became overwhelmingly stressed with all the things that need to be done (of course, that is related to our company being in the \u201cgrowth\u201d phase). I think I will be adjusting back to the polyphasic sleep schedule soon again.</p>\n<h3>The Zookeeper&#8217;s hardest job is not to find food for the animals but to prevent them from eating each other</h3>\n<p>The funny thing is, I\u2019m usually appreciated for the stuff that I feel I have the least credit for \u2013 fundraising. Fundraising actually does not take nearly as much effort from my part as a lot of other things I do. I feel like my most difficult work is to keep the team aligned and working smoothly together towards a common direction \u2013 the work of leadership. It takes a tremendous amount of work to be a good leader (which I am still very far away from). A good leader must recruit the smartest people she can find, people much smarter than herself. However, these people know they are smart and all have the most impressive egos too. None of them are used to someone disagreeing with them in their lives and still being correct. It\u2019s the CEO\u2019s job to make sure they not only work well with her but with EACH OTHER. A tremendous amount of startups fail because they can\u2019t align big egos together.</p>\n<h3>You build it. I show it. Everyone likes me.</h3>\n<p>On the other hand, when I successfully raised money, it\u2019s mostly my teammates\u2019 own credit. They have built a great product, got beta customers to sign up whom like it, and everything looks good. When that\u2019s the case, fundraising becomes a lot easier for me, and that\u2019s mostly their work. Before, the team may have ADD and constantly change directions. That makes it really hard to get enough traction and track record to raise money. But after the hard part of aligning everyone in the correct direction and staying discipline to it (this Is the hard part), fundraising becomes a lot more straightforward (which is the easier part).</p>\n<h3>It takes sloth to know sloth</h3>\n<p>So why is this case unique to the Startup CEO and not the big corporate CEO? The key difference is, the big corporate CEO works with people who are managing a bunch of others too, and so they see it as normal that \u201cmanagement and coordination\u201d takes up a lot of time. In startups, everyone is executing like crazy \u2013 the product is being built, potential customers are being reached, materials are being made, and current customers are being supported. In an environment of such hustle, it appears that the CEO is the one that isn\u2019t doing much.</p>\n<h3>Startup CEOs need more hugs</h3>\n<p>My team has worked with me for long enough (4 years), that we all trust and respect each others&#8217; work, and I feel like I no longer need to prove that I\u2019m actually working anymore (raising some funding helps :D). However, I now know that there are a lot of other startups that are facing the same challenges. People keep saying that being a Startup CEO is very lonely. It&#8217;s true. But if you happen to be the infamous Startup CEO, know that you are not alone. Others are just as lazy :P.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are one of the people who isn\u2019t sure if your CEO is doing anything, cut him some slack by seeing how much work he puts in to make sure the company is functioning normally, and recognize funding is the result of team effort, not merely the CEO\u2019s ability.</p>\n<h3>Startups need more hugs</h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, startups should have a stronger culture of appreciation. It\u2019s easy to criticize each other\u2019s imperfections, but it only makes things unproductive and unmotivating. If everyone is more appreciative of everyone else (not just to the CEO), then the Startup CEO actually will have a lot less work to do and more time to get stuff done.</p>\n<p>Btw, here&#8217;s a list of <a href=\"http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/34321/14-Ways-To-Be-A-Great-Startup-CEO.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">things good Startup CEOs actually do.</a></p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n",

Offline is no longer sexy.</p>\n<p>Today, it&#8217;s a very different story.</p>\n<h3>Loyalty Action is happening everywhere</h3>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/google-wallet-getting-digital-loyalty-cards-via-punchd-acquisition-20110712/\" target=\"_blank\">Punchd got acquired by Google for a speculative $10M</a> when they haven&#8217;t gotten any real traction yet.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-acquires-mobile-loyalty-reward-startup-tagtile/11770\" target=\"_blank\">Tagtile got acquired by Facebook</a> without accomplishing that much more. And most recently\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/belly-lands-10-million-from-andreessen-horowitz-customer-loyalty-for-smbs/76416\" target=\"_blank\">Belly raised $10M from Andreessen Horowitz</a> after showing they have 1400 stores and 200,000 users in 6 cities.</p>\n<p><strong>Many startups see that, and are creating a &#8220;built-to-flip&#8221; model, hoping for the same wins quickly. On the other hand, while Belly&#8217;s numbers seem large, it is still\u00a0minuscule compared to the market.</strong></p>\n<p>The challenge is, once you saturate your own\u00a0neighborhood\u00a0and try to expand into others, you hit a dead end when all the tech-savvy stores in the other cities are taken out by someone else. To me that&#8217;s like a game of Risk, where each square only has 1 solider on it, eventually getting no where.</p>\n<p><strong>In the meantime, companies like that are burning cash like crazy. </strong>They&#8217;re hiring foot soliders in more cities. They&#8217;re opening up new offices. They&#8217;re giving away iPads for free. \u00a0Belly already has 40 employees prior to the $10M funding. Ramping up might increase that to 100 employees. If each employee is conservatively paid $50,000 a year, that&#8217;s already $5M a year!</p>\n<p>That along with a multitude of other costs and free iPads, money is burnt quickly while they still just have a very small % of the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Consolidation in this industry won&#8217;t happen with a strategy like that.</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, if a large player such as Belly raises $1B one day and starts to acquire all the local players for $10M here and $40M there, perhaps it can capture a bit more of the market. Now we just gotta wait for that $1B investor to show up.</p>\n<h3>Consolidation of the Loyalty Industry will happen through capturing Large Chains</h3>\n<p>I personally believe that consolidation in this industry won&#8217;t happen from the dozens of solutions that each have a thousand mom-and-pop stores in their own cities, but will happen to whoever has the ability to tackle the hard problem of capturing the large brands and chain stores.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s truly prime real-estate that is growing (in store count), can scale nationwide, and can be defended as a sustainable advantage.\u00a0Yes, it takes longer to capture the chain stores at the beginning, but once you have it, a large chain like McDonald&#8217;s would use a solution because this solution is already being used by Carl&#8217;s Jr. instead of a ton of little burger stores.</p>\n<p>Once a large amount of the large chains use a solution, that will trickle down to the mom &amp; pop stores that aren&#8217;t even looking for the newest technologies, achieving true market penetration and potential consolidation.</p>\n<p><strong>This is the underlying thesis for RewardMe&#8217;s strategy &#8211; aim for market consolidation by targeting large chains early.</strong> RewardMe is not trying to be a quick-flip by selling door-to-door to hundreds of stores quickly and then hoping to be bought in a year, but we aim to be a solution that is the gold standard in the industry 10 years later with a proven ROI.</p>\n<h3>Scaling Prematurely is the #1 Reason for Startup Failure</h3>\n<p>A while ago, The Black Box Report started by the Startup Genome Project analyzed thousands of startups, and found that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/28/what-makes-a-startup-successful-blackbox-report-aims-to-map-the-startup-genome/\" target=\"_blank\">the number one for startup failure is premature scaling</a>. In fact, we&#8217;ve gone down that path too.</p>\n<p>RewardMe was probably one of the earliest companies to take an iPhone/Android App that scans QR codes and go door-to-door to sell a loyalty solution back in 2010.</p>\n<p><strong>We found that one person could quickly get 70+ stores to participate in 2 months. </strong>However, we also found out that our solution is not ideal and the value we create is fluffy at best. Instead of continuing to capture more stores with a faulty model (many players are doing exactly that these days), we decided to pivot and actually introduce something of lasting value.</p>\n<p>Serving chain stores aren&#8217;t easy. Instead of less sophisticated mom-and-pop owners who don&#8217;t invest in much marketing nor understand deep analytics, chain store executives are completely focused on metrics, data, and ROI.</p>\n<h3>What doesn&#8217;t kill you make you stronger</h3>\n<p>Because of that, we were forced to create a product that not only sounds fancy, but delivers actual metrics. And with that discipline, we were forced to stay &#8220;small&#8221; until we created a product that performs more than 10X better than other &#8220;successful&#8221; companies.</p>\n<p><strong>We also became the only company that could measure direct ROI</strong>, instead of wondering whether user average growth increases are a result of customer segmentation or revenue lift causation.</p>\n<p>All this has finally paid off, as we are getting deals from some of the largest national chains, charging fees up to $1000/mo every store.</p>\n<h3>A Barrier of a Thousand Cuts</h3>\n<p>And even though our &#8220;store count&#8221; doesn&#8217;t sound as impressive as some other startups, the work we have put in to satisfy chain stores both from a sales cycle front and a product front has become a very tangible moat that prevents others from catching up before we have meaningful market share that builds on itself.</p>\n<p><strong>In the past year, we have literally discovered thousands of little challenges and adjustments that made us the perfect solution we are today for chains, and most other companies don&#8217;t even know these challenges exist yet.</strong></p>\n<p>Over all, I think the plethora of loyalty solutions may become successful, especially when some bigger company just wants to buy a player in the press that has many stores. But I believe in terms of industry consolidation, they don&#8217;t have the right product nor the right strategy to tackle the market. And that&#8217;s what RewardMe is betting all our chips on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/market/pos-industry-fragmented/\" target=\"_blank\">You can also check out my analysis of the POS Industry and how I believe it will always be fragmented.</a></p>\n",

New iPad based POS companies like Square are doing great, but there are many many others that are coming up. I&#8217;ve heard of half a dozen new POS systems that just came out just this year.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Essentially, the POS/payment space is a commodity. No stores have been saying, &#8220;I wish I could process payments better&#8221;, nor customers saying, &#8220;I will I could pay better&#8221;. Some merchants pick POS systems based on reputation (which suggests reliability), but many just pick it due to cheaper costs. <strong>When there aren&#8217;t any &#8220;features&#8221; that are there that could make you win outside of pricing, you are a commodity that is less differentiated.</strong></div>\n<div><strong><br />\n</strong></div>\n<h3>A deep\u00a0psychological\u00a0fear</h3>\n<div>But the reason why I think the POS industry will always be fragmented goes deeper than that.\u00a0\u00a0When I started working on RewardMe, I was\u00a0surprised\u00a0that one chain store wouldn&#8217;t all use the same POS systems. In fact, even if they only had 9 stores, they could have 4 different POS systems within it.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Here&#8217;s the reason:\u00a0It&#8217;s a really difficult challenge to try to displace something so fundamental in a store&#8217;s operation as a POS system. This extends beyond just the cost, operations, or technology challenges. <strong>It is more connected to a deeper\u00a0psychological\u00a0fear of the store owners when they have to change their POS systems.</strong></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><strong><br />\n</strong></div>\n<div>Again, very few of the merchants feel like they are solving a pain in collecting payments, giving back change etc. so why change what&#8217;s not broken?</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<h3>POS Systems are like the Tree Ring for Chains</h3>\n</div>\n<div><strong><br />\n</strong></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>In the case of a chain, maybe in 1995 everyone was using a certain type of POS. And then in 2001, the corporate decides that another POS system is better, and wants everyone to use it. However, very few of the stores actually want to switch their POS systems, so corporate could only manage to get the new stores in the chain to start with the new POS.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>That goes on for another 3 years, and corporate then decides on yet another POS company. Eventually, the POS technology even becomes fragmented within a chain!</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><strong>If the corporate office of a chain cannot have enough clout to overcome the\u00a0psychological\u00a0resistance of displacing a bad/outdated POS system, it is certainly hard to be convinced that a new technology startup could do that easily with scale.</strong> (And this is why RewardMe decided to become POS Agnostic so we could create value for chains regardless of what POS system they use)</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>So what about Square?</h3>\n<div>Back to the good old question. Square is very successful right now! Haven&#8217;t they proved that this challenge can be overcome?</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>However, even for Square, their success has not been in displacing the POS of existing stores. Square has been very successful at reaching out to micro-merchants who wouldn&#8217;t have a POS in the first place.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Bringing unavailable technology to a new niche is a strong play, and Square has done well in that. But once you saturated that new niche, bringing in a better technology in an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">already established</span> yet <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">HIGHLY fragmented</span> space is tough.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>RewardMe&#8217;s success is independent of POS systems</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>We think POS companies like Square and Revel are great companies that could even partner with or leverage RewardMe&#8217;s technology. Either way, their successes\u00a0won&#8217;t interfere with the growth and success of RewardMe</div>\n",

However, it doesn&#8217;t always happen. Mostly by luck, I was able to create some content that went viral.</p>\n<p>The blogpost I will refer to here is: <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/social-media/seesmic-desktop-destroy-tweetdeck/\">Seesmic will Destory Tweetdeck</a></p>\n<h3>1. Say something controversial in the title (but use the best objective and logical statements to support it)</h3>\n<p>People love controversial stuff. As long as you truly believe in what you say and can back it up, throw up a controversial posts and give people a reason to click on it. If you just say something like, &#8220;Seesmic Desktop emerges as an alternative to Tweetdeck&#8221;, people won&#8217;t care, and they won&#8217;t share it.</p>\n<h3>2. Include at least one name that people have heard of in the title</h3>\n<p><!--more-->People will only click on your post if they recognize what you are talking about. In this case, most people on Twitter knows about Tweetdeck, and Seesmic has a strong brandname in general on the internet. When you include something that people know and care about, they will check it out. If I said, &#8220;FriendTweets will destroy Qualiky&#8221;, people won&#8217;t pay attention because they don&#8217;t know the competing parties. (I have both domains btw if you are interested :P)</p>\n<h3>3. Marketing Gamification Tip: Support people with influential power on the internet</h3>\n<p>You want to write posts that make influential people look good. You want to write something so good, that they want everyone in the world to read it. No matter how awesome they are, it&#8217;s more lame to say, &#8220;Yea, we&#8217;re the best and you should use our products.&#8221; But if SOMEONE ELSE writes, &#8220;Yea, they are the best, and you should use their products&#8221; it suddenly becomes a lot more compelling. I just happened to support Loic since I truly believed he had the better product for me.</p>\n<p>Because of this, when the post was published, Loic tweeted it out multiple times and wrote a blogpost about it. That helped tremendously (this post itself was retweeted almost 100 times).</p>\n<h3>4. Write an extremely elaborated post that includes as much details and analysis as possible</h3>\n<p>A lot of people talk about writing short, crisp posts. They say people don&#8217;t have the attention span to read long posts. I completely agree with that. However, after chatting with <a href=\"http://mixergy.com\">Andrew Warner from Mixergy</a> (one of the BEST sources for entrepreneur education btw!), we both agreed that people read short posts, but dont&#8217; share it, whereas with long posts people just skim, but they bookmark it and share it with others.</p>\n<p>Think about those posts that give you 100 links to something. No one&#8217;s going to click through all 100 links. They&#8217;re not even going to read all the anchor texts. But they save it and share it with others.</p>\n<h3>5. Tweet relevant people and ask them to retweet</h3>\n<p>Everything that goes viral needs a starting point. Twitter is a good tool to find that starting point. A good tip is to go on Twitter and search for everyone who is talking about the topic you are writing about. In this case Seesmic Desktop. I could do Tweetdeck more, but they are less targeted because everyone could talk about Tweetdeck for anything. However, people who talk about Seesmic Desktop are either people who are thinking about using it, or the early adapters of this new app, and they would care about any literature that explains the great things about it.</p>\n<p>Also, if you have space, politely ask them to Retweet it for you. For those who do retweet it, make sure you send a thank you tweet and try to help them out if possible.</p>\n<h3>6. Include social media influencers and let them know about it</h3>\n<p>This is KEY. A few days before I wrote the blogpost, I saw <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zaibatsu\">Zaibatsu</a> (super awesome Social Media Maven&#8230;yes, one of the VERY few people who mean it when they say it.) tweet out his frustration about using Tweetdeck. I thought it would add some colors to my post if I included it. After I published it, I tweeted Zaibatsu and asked him if it was ok that I have an old tweet there, since it also had an abbreviated cuss word.</p>\n<p>My tweet was actually really sincere and just wondered if he would prefer me to take it down. However, he didn&#8217;t respond to me but merely retweeted the post. Immediately afterwards, dozens and dozens of people started retweeting that post too. It went wild and crazy, just because Zaibatsu decided that it was good content.</p>\n<p>This is actually another lesson about Twitter: follower count does not matter. Authority through engagement is what truly matters. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you have a million followers if no one cares about what you say. Zaibatsu has built up a reputation where people trust his authority and trust his selection of content. I believe many of them didn&#8217;t even read the post before retweeting it.</p>\n<p>If you are a company or looking to build a personal brand, don&#8217;t just amass numbers. Get people who care about and trust you.</p>\n<h3>7. Engage with the community and respond to all comments</h3>\n<p>After the blogpost started getting a lot more attention, tons of people started to comment on the post. Many companies make the mistake of just letting people comment but do not engage with the commenters themselves. However, it feels good to have a writer respond to you, so I strongly recommend engaging everyone&#8217;s comments, whether they are compliments or simply <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/society/government-pay-entrepreneurs-salaries-save-economy/#comments\">saying how ignorant and disgusting you are</a>.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps, and I look forward to one day stumble upon your viral post! Contact me if you ever need help with anything, anytime!</p>\n",

That&#8217;s actually not true. Starting is the easiest part and it just requires you to get off your butt and start doing things. You only think it&#8217;s the hardest part because that&#8217;s the part YOU are stuck on.</p>\n<p>For that reason, here&#8217;s a little guide to help you get over that &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know how to start!&#8221; hurdle, so you will have no excuse not knowing how to start your company.</p>\n<h3>Days 1-5: Decide to be an Entrepreneur and learn as much as you can about it</h3>\n<p>This is the day that you finally decide to take that leap of faith and begin a real life. Some people start this day by being laid off, but hopefully you came to this conclusion on your own terms.</p>\n<p><!--more-->This doesn&#8217;t mean you have to quit your job immediately, but it means you need to start thinking like an entrepreneur. You need to train your mind to think creatively, to discover opportunities, to become a leader, and to become an explorer of life.</p>\n<p>You should also start reading about what does entrepreneurship entail and to learn as much as you can about it. I recommend reading <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/articles.html\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Graham&#8217;s Essays</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s Blog</a>, and<a href=\"http://edcorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Stanford&#8217;s Entrepreneurial Thought Leadership Series</a>.</p>\n<p>Spend as much time as you can everyday reading up on these materials and listen to these podcasts everyday because sounding like you know what you are doing is very important in the startup world.</p>\n<p>Finally, find people who have been there, done that and learn about their experiences. <a href=\"http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2007/04/17/how-to-ask-for-mentoring/\" target=\"_blank\">Ask them</a> to become your mentor or advisor. They can seriously prevent you from <a href=\"http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01/05/7-things-to-consider-before-launching-a-startup/\" target=\"_blank\">running into some walls</a> that they ran into when they were doing it.</p>\n<h3>Days 6-10: Find your Passion</h3>\n<p>This is the time to find out what you are truly <a href=\"http://learnthis.ca/2007/12/passion-find-your-passion-in-life/\" target=\"_blank\">passionate about</a>. Running a business is tough, and to survive through all the beatings and destruction, you MUST be passionate about what you are doing. Or else you quit and die.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to find your passion, and none of them work 100% of the time. I recommend you to think about the past years and write down EVERYTHING that made you happy. Write down things that you spent the most time on. Write down things that made you feel meaningful about life.</p>\n<p>Your passion can be as broad as you want: fashion, helping people, making better technology&#8230;.anything, but just know that it is something that can make you happy.</p>\n<h3>Days 10-20: Identify a large problem in the field you are passionate about and find your co-founder(s)</h3>\n<p>Once you know the field that you are most passionate about, try to identify problems and pains in this field that have not been solved yet.</p>\n<p>Since this is a field you care a lot about, you are hopefully part of the <a href=\"http://www.exhib-it.com/blog/2009/02/23/your-target-market-and-the-need-to-focus/\" target=\"_blank\">target market</a>, and you know what are the things that just have to have a better solution to them.</p>\n<p>Make sure you focus on <a href=\"http://disruptivethoughts.com/2007/01/08/aspirin-vs-vitamins/\" target=\"_blank\">Aspirins instead of Vitamins</a>. One solves a real PAIN, while the other is just a good-to-have. With <a href=\"http://www.bspcn.com/2007/11/21/6-brilliant-marketing-campaigns/\" target=\"_blank\">EXTREMELY good marketing</a>, you can do well with Vitamins. However, if you already have that brilliant marketing ability, it would only be more successful if you were selling an Aspirin.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to stress about thinking up the solution, but at least list out all the problems that you potentially want to solve.</p>\n<p>Then you want to find co-founders who can fight with you on your journey.This <a href=\"http://junloayza.com\" target=\"_blank\">Co-founder</a> should have the same passion but with complementary skills to you.</p>\n<p>Co-founders are exceptionally important because they help you go through the tough times and alleviate some of the loneliness of entrepreneurial life. As an entrepreneur, your family and friends will not understand what you are doing, and the only people that you truly share your pains with are your partners.</p>\n<p>The order of these two can be switched. You can choose to find co-founders first and identify the problems in that field if you like. However, you should definitely come up with the solution to the problem together.</p>\n<h3>Days 20-30: Find a Solution to the Problem you Identified</h3>\n<p>With your co-founders, you should meet up everyday and brainstorm about potential solutions to the problems you identified.</p>\n<p>Be as creative as possible. Think inside, outside, and inbetween the box. And then pretend there is no box.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be scared to yell at each other. You will be yelling at each other throughout the startup process, so might as well start now. Just don&#8217;t take things personally.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure you are market focused instead of product focused. Make sure your solution/product is not something that&#8217;s just &#8220;really cool&#8221; but something that actually addresses the need in the market. Also make sure your product is economically viable. You won&#8217;t find enough buyers if you solve a small problem with twice the original price.</p>\n<p>Finally, create some Milestones, Assumptions, and Tasks for your business.</p>\n<h3>Days 30-40: Assign Roles, Tell ALMOST everyone about your new business idea</h3>\n<p>At this point, you and your co-founders should identify the roles and responsibilities everyone has in the firm. Rolls should be assigned based on the person&#8217;s abilities and expertise, which should end up being obvious if you truly picked people with complementary skills as you do. Make sure everyone is accountable for his/her tasks.</p>\n<p>Also, almost at all times, the original vision of a startup ends up being completely changed. That&#8217;s a good thing, because startups need to be adaptable. You as an entrepreneur need to talk to as many people as you can to get feedback.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that most of your friends will tell you that your idea is great, even if your idea was a samurai sword that makes the noise of a rooster crow whenever you draw it out of the sheath. (Btw, one day I will make this product. Trust me.) Pay attention to the people who raise problems and issues so you can truly increase your chances of success.</p>\n<p>Now there are some people who just tell you that your plans will never work without giving you any real reasons. Ignore them. These are people who wished they were doing something extraordinary but ended up hating their life. Don&#8217;t let them bring your spirit down.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid of people stealing your ideas. Most people are too lazy to even do their own brilliant ideas, let alone yours. Plus success is all in the execution.</p>\n<p>I would say the ONLY people you need to be concerned about sharing your ideas with are companies that are already doing something similar. If that is the case, it would be very easy for them to just tweak their products to make it like yours.</p>\n<p>By the way, at this point it is good to have a company name, but don&#8217;t kill yourself over it. It is up to you to get business cards but first focus on tasks that make your actual business more valuable, like developing the product.</p>\n<p>Finally, don&#8217;t bother wasting time registering for a legal structure. No one will sue you yet, and your stocks are worth nothing.</p>\n<h3>Days 40-60: Recruit necessary talents and talk to potential investors</h3>\n<p>Now that you have obtained a lot of education from your field, learned about your market, and bullet-proofed your product idea (not!), you should know by now what are your lacking resources.</p>\n<p>For almost all startups, the resources that are lacking are money and people.</p>\n<p>Spend most of your time selling your vision to people who have the production skills, perhaps in the engineering or design field, instead of investors. If you convince them that your startup has huge potentials and could make their lives more meaningful, a lot of people are willing to work at least part-time for free or for some stock. You can pay them too if you have the cash.</p>\n<p>The reason why I say don&#8217;t spend too much time on investor is because a lot of the times they&#8217;re not worth the effort. It takes a lot of precious energy and time to pitch to investors, especially in a <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/30/the-first-time-ceos-recession-survival-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">down economy</a>. This holds true even more so when you don&#8217;t even have a product yet, and are an unproven time.</p>\n<p>Plus, where would all the money go to when you raise the money? Probably paying people anyway. You might as well focus on getting people to help out and have them share part of the company instead of the investors.</p>\n<p>With that said, you should still probe around to raise a little money from the 3F: Friends, Families and Fools. They might put down a little bit just to get you going, but don&#8217;t waste time on an entire business plan just for pitching investors. Have a <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/fdlink/viralogy-presentation-presentation\" target=\"_blank\">power point deck</a> and possibly an executive summary and you are good to go.</p>\n<h3>Days 60-70: Build a website, Develop key partnerships, introduce Gamification and Brand your company</h3>\n<p>At this stage, you should start branding yourself everywhere,<a href=\"http://localtechwire.com/business/local_tech_wire/biotech/story/1163157/\" target=\"_blank\"> even before you launch</a> your product. Everyone should be waiting for your product when it launches.</p>\n<p>One of the most important things nowadays is to have a website. Nowadays people judge your credibility by your website. If you don&#8217;t have one, no one will do business with you.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a lot of resources, you can set up a simple WordPress site with a template design that talks about your company. You can also find some good wordpress designers that can create a cool site for a low fee.</p>\n<p>At the same time, start building relationships with key people in your industry so you can establish partnerships that will help your business. Depending on your line of business, this could be either helpful or essential.</p>\n<p>Utilize the power of Social Media and Search Engine Optimization. To brand your company well, you should start blogging about topics in your industry and build followship on Twitter. You should also make sure your website is key-word optimized so people can find your company without you marketing it with money.</p>\n<h3>Days 70-80: Get the legal stuff out of the way</h3>\n<p>If you have survived to this point, you know you are committed enough to function like a real company. Now is a good time to establish your formal legal structure (earlier you functioned as a Partnership), whether it be a <a href=\"http://stakeventures.com/articles/2005/06/01/legal-structures-for-bootstrappers\" target=\"_blank\">S-Corp, C-Corp, or LLC</a>.</p>\n<p>This is an important step but I just want to make sure you don&#8217;t waste the money and effort before your company has any value developed.</p>\n<h3>Days 80-90: Focus on your product and launch as soon as possible</h3>\n<p>After almost 3 months of hard work, your company is finally ready to flow into Phase 2 of a startup. You need to make sure that your product is launched as fast as possible because markets change very fast and you can always improve it later on. Market validation is extremely important for both your business and investors</p>\n<p>Make sure whatever you make comes out with a good design. Think about cars. A company could make a car that is 20% more efficient and 10% faster than any other car out there, but if it looks UGLY, all that brilliant engineering is wasted because no one will buy it.</p>\n<p>Finally, keep your product as simple as possible. You only want that KEY feature that solves the PAIN you identified at the beginning. Bells and Whistles only delay your launch time and distract people from using and remembering your product for its core features.</p>\n<h3>The Journey Goes On</h3>\n<p>Since every business has unique needs and tasks, I won&#8217;t be able to tell you what lies ahead for you. Fortunately or unfortunately, at this point all sorts of tasks and problems will pop up for you to solve, so you will not need a guide to tell you what to do.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to remind you is that always focus on things that are important instead of urgent, maintain passion, don&#8217;t give up, always keep your integrity, and watch your business grow.</p>\n<p>The world needs more entrepreneurs.

You work your butt off and get paid almost nothing for years, and the chances are you will fail at the end. Living the entrepreneurial life is definitely not the &#8220;easy&#8221; life.</p>\n<p>However, in my opinion, it is the most fulfilling one.</p>\n<p>I believe that being an entrepreneur is the best way to make sure you live a life of passion and adventure &#8211; a life that leaves you a legacy and stories to tell your grand kids.</p>\n<h3>The corporate life story</h3>\n<p>Lets look at a regular corporate life person. This person graduates from college, finds a job, gets married, possibly gets an advanced degree, has kids, advances in her job, gets old, and then there&#8217;s goodbye. That just sounds very unfulfilling to me, especially when you are working at a job you hate like most people are.</p>\n<p>Sure, some people love their jobs, and I&#8217;m all for that, but <strong>most people settle for a job that they don&#8217;t like just because they are afraid of change and and slowly wait for their midlife crisis. </strong></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when they buy their fast car.</p>\n<p>Even for those of you who say you love your jobs, if you suddenly had $10M in your bank account, how many of you will choose to quit your job this week?</p>\n<p>Yes, you might say that this question is unfair as you could say that about anything. However, I can tell you as a sure fact that <strong>lots of successful entrepreneurs who HAVE over $10 Million in their bank accounts keep going back to the torturous startup life because it is just too exciting and addicting to stay away from!</strong></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>Gamification Principle: Live for adventure instead of self-sustaining</h3>\n<p>Lets say you do have a six digit high-paying job. How many years can you afford to stop working and do whatever you want? Probably not that many. You have to continuously work for decades at that job until you finally saved up enough money in your 401(k) when you are 65 and retire (hopefully!). That&#8217;s when you can start to fully discover your passions and go traveling/golfing all day. In this way, you spend 40 years of your life just to sustain it for longer before doing the things that you are passionate about.</p>\n<p>The life of an entrepreneur is more dynamic and more exciting in my opinion. When you are young, you have a dream and a passion. You gather some friends and go through tons of struggles, mistakes, disappointments and some victories together to create that world-changing business. I usually say that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">running a startup is not really a career. Its a lifestyle.</span> For instance, if you were doing a Lord of the Rings journey, you wouldn&#8217;t just say &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to travel 40 hours a week and watch TV for the rest of the time.&#8221; Of course not! You will be constantly dealing with problems and evil creatures while counting the hours that you can afford to sleep.</p>\n<p>People don&#8217;t join that LOTR journey because it is luxurious or they can get a fancy car. People join because they 1. believe in the mission (destroying the ring), and 2. they like the people they are traveling with.</p>\n<p>I believe living a life like that is way more meaningful than just living a comfortably sustained life in The Shire. I would rather die poor doing the mission I believe in than live richly without ever pursuing the things I&#8217;m passionate about.</p>\n<h3>Being an entrepreneur creates an opportunity to truly be financially free at a young age after a great ride.</h3>\n<p>Now the other side of the story. You could be trying and failing for fives years or ten years, but WHEN you hit that big home run, you will earn enough money to do whatever you want to do for the rest of your life. This is dramatically different from a normal high paying job, because this allows you to possibly take full control of your life at a young age.</p>\n<p>You could literally retire before 30 and live the life you want to. Yes, I agree the odds that this happening is low, but that is fine because the pursuit of your dreams is what makes life worth living, not necessarily the obtaining of it.</p>\n<p>Also, as Robert Kiyosaki (Rich Dad, Poor Dad author) says, &#8220;Nine out of ten startups fail. That just means I only need to create ten businesses and one will become successful!&#8221;</p>\n<p>After you make it big, you can then go golfing, traveling, do philanthropy, or create more companies! Many successful entrepreneurs choose to do all of them.</p>\n<h4>Successful or not, entrepreneurs take control of their own lives.</h4>\n<p>Notice that in this case both phases of being an entrepreneur (struggle and success), you are doing what you want to do and free to choose how you want to do it, whereas in the corporate world you can only choose what makes the shareholders more profitable.</p>\n<p>I would rather live a purposeful and adventurous life that &#8220;could&#8221; fulfill my dreams socially and financially than live a life just to sustain my existence for longer and buy cool stuff.</p>\n<h3>The best time to start a business for you just passed. The second best time to start a business is NOW.</h3>\n<p>Yea, most people want to start their own businesses, but always feel that the right time will come &#8220;later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guess what? <strong>As time goes by your external responsibilities in life will only increase as your energy level decreases. </strong></p>\n<p>The best time is to start as early as possible (even in college!). Later on you will have a mortgage, you&#8217;ll have a family, your kids needs to go to college, and then you will need to save up for retirement while dealing with some new financial crisis. The best time to start a business will never arrive to you (actually lots of people become entrepreneurs after they get laid off so I take that back).</p>\n<p>Just remember that you want to take the most risks when you have the least to lose. And that&#8217;s when you are young (or younger).</p>\n<p>Every once in awhile I hear some naysayers challenge me by saying, &#8220;well if everyone becomes an entrepreneur, then there will be no employees and the world will not function!&#8221; I think this argument is bull because even though I agree with the logic, the truth is that even if I told the whole world to become entrepreneurs, only 5% will make real plans to become one, and only 0.2% will follow through and actually start a business. Of course, getting more education like getting an\u00a0<a title=\"Gannon Online MBA\" href=\"http://online.gannon.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Gannon online MBA</a> degree can always help you, regardless if you want to become an entrepreneur or an executive at a large firm.</p>\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s not an issue anyone really needs to worry about. Its just a feel-good excuse to stay in the comfortable cubicles and not do anything different. All you have to worry about is to make sure you are part of that 0.2% who decides to take a leap of faith and make your life into an epic adventure.</p>\n<p>I invite you to join the Real Life, where you actually have control over how you live it and what you do with it. It is yours completely, and the legacy is for yours to win or loss.</p>\n",

Even if you choose to keep your name anonymous, by logging your activity, you are giving potential identity thieves some very useful data.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is true of everything in today\u2019s online world. We\u2019re so used to our data being all out there that we often don\u2019t think twice about it. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/24/terms-and-conditions-online-small-print-information\">agree to all T&amp;C\u2019s</a>; we give every retailer our credit card details; we confess important personal information all the time.</p>\n<p>Much of the reason we\u2019re so willing to give up our personal information is that it no longer seems like we have a choice. Sooner or later, Apple, Google, Facebook, and all their affiliated advertisers will know everything there is to know about us. And sooner or later, there\u2019ll be a big breach that gives criminals access to the identities of everyone online.</p>\n<p>But that does not have to be the case. It is still possible to keep a handle on our identities, but to do this we have to take the necessary steps.</p>\n<h3><strong>Be sparing with your personal details</strong></h3>\n<p>It may feel like everything\u2019s out there already, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be so easy to access. We&#8217;re not advocating that you live like a survivalist, expecting the end of the world just around the corner. But make sure that when you sign up for something, the service is reputable and trustworthy.</p>\n<p>Even with reputable services, be careful. <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/social-media-passwords-why-you-shouldnt-reuse-or-share-them-your-spouse-2556293\">Do not reuse passwords</a> \u2013 if you do, hackers will be able to access all your accounts with what they glean from just one attack. Ideally, have a billing address that is not your home address, and don\u2019t share your home address with anyone unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n<h3><strong>Use a VPN</strong></h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network\">virtual private network (VPN)</a> is touted by many as a solution to everything, from FBI surveillance to the gaze of your neighborhood hacker. Well, it\u2019s definitely not a panacea, but it does do a lot to keep you safer than most.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bestonlinereviews.com/vpn/best-vpn-services/\">best VPN service</a> will hide your location and encrypt your data without keeping any logs of their own. This last point is important. If they keep user logs, stay away from them. They may have innocent reasons behind it, but if they get hacked then you&#8217;re back at square one again.</p>\n<p>Also, remember that you&#8217;re going to have to pay for a VPN actually worth its salt.

Traffic is a quantitative number that is easy to measure and helps you see important trends and how successful campaigns are. However, especially for sites that need some kind of conversion like signing up or buying a product, undifferentiated traffic can be misleading.</p>\n<h3>A visitor is a real person</h3>\n<p>Traffic is the amount of visitors on your site. When you say &#8220;visitors&#8221;, these are actually real people, and everyone has their own personalities, their motives, and their own wants. Yes, sometimes it&#8217;s just a numbers game where a small % of your traffic will convert. However, wouldn&#8217;t you actually want 100 people on your site that are looking to really buy things than have 1000 people who are just surfing?</p>\n<h3>Stumbleupon gives high quantitative but low qualitative traffic</h3>\n<p>This misconception in traffic-success is most obviously seen with <a href=\"http://stumbleupon.com\">StumbleUpon</a>. When you get &#8220;Stumbled&#8221;, your traffic that day will increase gigantically. However, chances are your average time on site will decrease dramatically. That is because Stumble can get you a lot of traffic, but not a lot of quality traffic. Even if people did read your post or article, they&#8217;re in a pure surfing mode and will likely not signup or buy your services.</p>\n<p>In that sense, I came up with three qualitative metrics that is important to consider when driving visitors to your site. These metrics are: Relevancy, Timing, and Trust.</p>\n<h3>1. Relevancy</h3>\n<p>Relevancy is whether this person is actually part of your target market. If you own a sports site that is looking to get subscription and merchandise purchases, but the visitor on your site is not really that interested in sports and never buys anything online, this person is not relevant. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you have 10,000 people like that on your site. You won&#8217;t convert anything.</p>\n<p><!--more-->Obviously when people are on your site, they are hopefully already somewhat relevant based on how they got there. However, some people are more relevant than others, such as a hardcore sports fan compared to a guy who is curious about his girlfriend&#8217;s favorite sports team.</p>\n<h3>2. Timing</h3>\n<p>You might have very relevant people on your site, but the timing is not correct. What that means is that this might be a hardcore sports fan, but he is not looking to buy any merchandise. He might not even be looking to subscribe to a new service. All he is doing is looking for quick stats about the last game.</p>\n<p>When that&#8217;s the case, this is not the right timing for you to convert this visitor. In the long run, he might be more aware of your website and may come back again, but you won&#8217;t have any conversions up front.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you have potential customers going onto your site just to do research and compare prices. These people are highly relevant but it is not the right timing. Maybe they will come back two weeks later to make a purchase.</p>\n<h3>3. Trust</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you will get visitors on your site that is highly relevant, and they are looking to buy or sign up to something, but they don&#8217;t really know much about your site and they don&#8217;t really trust you. When that happens, people will be highly interested, look around a lot, but end up not converting.</p>\n<p>Trust comes from branding, mindshare, and most importantly, recommendations. If a customer walks into your store because her friend recommended it to her, you are likely to have a sale. Similarly, if people refer their friends to your site, then you will get traffic that trusts you.</p>\n<h3>Search Engine Marketing is great with Relevancy and Timing but not with Trust</h3>\n<p>So given this model, Search Engine Marketing, whether it be through Adwords or SEO, does a GREAT job in finding people with high relevancy and good timing. It&#8217;s given them what people are looking for, WHEN they are looking for it. If someone is searching for plumbing services, chances are this person is interesting in converting into a plumber customer.</p>\n<p>However, what SEM forgoes is the trust factor. When you find a website through a search engine, you do not trust the website other than what you see from the website itself (that&#8217;s why sites need to put up all these testimonials from their siblings).</p>\n<p>Since search engines take an automated process, it is very difficult for traffic from that source to develop really strong trust.</p>\n<h3>Social Media Marketing fulfills that Trust gap</h3>\n<p>This is where Social Media Marketing comes in place. If I followed <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/\">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s blog</a> for 6 months, and he suddenly says, &#8220;This is a great product. All Social Media Entrepreneurs should use this,&#8221; that&#8217;s trust established. Now I trust the brand and when I go onto the site, I have a much higher chance of converting.</p>\n<p>If I was looking for an executive search service and I have been tweeting with someone that does a service for months, I will think of him and approach him before searching it on Google. And if my friends need the same service, I will refer them to this Twitter friend that I have. Trust again is established through social.</p>\n<p>From a company standpoint, if your firm has a blog that constantly updates the latest news and insights on your industry, you can become the go-to place for people who care about your industry to check out and learn. If a person has been reading from your company blog for years, when he suddenly needs a service like yours, he is not going to find a random company on Google. He is coming to you.</p>\n<h3>Study shows Social Media Marketing has a strong ROI for companies</h3>\n<p>Previously I created a video about the <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/social-media/roi-social-media/\">ROI of Social Media</a>, saying that Social Media is like branding build and networking: no immediate ROI but indispensable for business (actually you can generate immediate ROI if you do the right techniques).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.cisco.com/ciscotalk/marketing/comments/the_correlation_between_social_media_revenue/\" target=\"_blank\">A report</a> by <a title=\"Wetpaint\" href=\"http://www.wetpaint.com/\">Wetpaint</a>, a social media platform, and <a title=\"Altimeter Group\" href=\"http://www.altimetergroup.com/\">Altimeter Group</a>, a digital strategies consulting group, shows that companies who are highly engaged in social media on average increased their revenue by 18% last year, while companies who do not engage in has a drop of 6% on average.</p>\n<p>The study actually takes the world\u2019s 100 most valuable brands as measured by BusinessWeek/Interbrand \u201cBest Global Brands 2008\u201d rankings and breaks them into four categories based on how engaged they are in social media. The chart in their report shows that there is a pretty strong correlation (note: not neceesarily causation) between the engagement on a platform and revenue growth.</p>\n<h3>Blog banner ads have a stronger ROI than measured</h3>\n<p>Another interesting thing I noticed is that the 125&#215;125 banner ad on a blog actually has a lot higher ROI than the click-through data suggests. The reason for that is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">readers care about how bloggers they follow are monetizing their blogs</span>. If you have been following a blogger for 6 months and you suddenly see a 125&#215;125 ad on their site, you begin to wonder, &#8220;Wow, this person has ads on his blog now. I wonder how much are they paying him. Is it something super spammy or something that the blogger actually supports.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I can tell you that right now I don&#8217;t need to get any type of credit, but when I do, the first name I would think about is credit-land. The reason? They were the first to put a banner on my Co-founder Jun Loayza&#8217;s <a href=\"http://junloayza.com\" target=\"_blank\">Young Entrepreneur Blog</a>. They didn&#8217;t get any click-through from me, hence from a data standpoint, their banner was a failed campaign towards me. However, they were actually very effective and I might just one day find them through Google or type in their direct traffic. That&#8217;s the value of brand, not a click-through.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when Viralogy grew to the point where we didn&#8217;t think <a href=\"http://bluehost.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bluehost</a> was the right solution anymore, it was an automatic response, &#8220;Alright. Time to move on to <a href=\"http://mediatemple.net\" target=\"_blank\">Media Temple</a>.&#8221; How do I know about Media Temple? I consistently see their 125&#215;125 banner on Tech Crunch. Not once have I ever clicked on the banner, but they&#8217;re now making hundreds of dollars from my company and will continue to do so for years until they piss me off.</p>\n<p>I actually remember reading from <a href=\"http://quicksprout.com\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Patel&#8217;s Blog</a> that there was a study showing that companies who put on banner ads on blogs generate more revenue, even without a lot of click-thrus. That&#8217;s all consistent with what I observed in the social media plane.</p>\n<h3>The best internet marketing strategy</h3>\n<p>So with all the tools, methods, and different types of marketing techniques out there, what is the most ideal? How do I get tons and tons of people onto my site who are relevant with right timing and who also happens to trust me? Well, this takes an entire blogpost that is longer than this to answer, but here are some of my suggestions for anyone who has a company:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Always be aware of <a href=\"http://seoexpert.tv\" target=\"_blank\">SEO</a> and make sure your site is friendly to search engines in a white hat way.</li>\n<li>Build a blog and focus on creating value to your readers. Give news and insights about your industry and update once a week without talking about yourself</li>\n<li>If you have a budget, utilize Adwords to drive traffic. Since this cost money, make sure you are driving high quality traffic to your site that has a high chance of converting.</li>\n<li>Build relationships with bloggers. Use tools like Viralogy.com to locate the top influencers in your niche. Comment on their blogs, link to them, and learn from them. If they like you, then you got part of the trust factor</li>\n<li>Engage in Twitter. Just like blogging, create value for your followers. Tweet about insights and news in your industry mixed with personal notes and feelings. Don&#8217;t just promote your product.</li>\n<li>Create a Twitter Search Stream that constantly updates you when people talk about your industry, your product, your company, your competitors, and the pains you solve. Whenever someone says, &#8220;yourcompetitor.com is so frustrating!&#8221; or &#8220;I am in such painyousolve!&#8221; then you should tweet back immediately, saying, &#8220;Hey! We solve your problems and it&#8217;s free to try out. Let me know if you need help with anything!&#8217;</li>\n<li>Create email marketing lists. As unsexy as it sounds, email marketing still works, especially when it&#8217;s <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html\" target=\"_blank\">Permission Based</a>. Some marketers call their email list their ATM machines. They send out something, and ka-ching comes out.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are obviously a lot more ways to do internet marketing, but if you do the tips above and do them REALLY REALLY well, you&#8217;ll be attracting the right traffic for both shortterm AND longterm gains. You generate sales and build a brand. With social media, you are in a new era of internet marketing. Take advantage of it and do it right.</p>\n",

What more, it\u2019s a form of entertainment that has helped a great multitude of people, from all walks of life, to get through difficult circumstances at various times in the world history. During the times of economic depression, people used to stay entertained by playing bingo at non-operational movie theatres. </span></p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Furthermore, it\u2019s a proven and well-documented fact that playing bingo the conventional way or on the internet can help boost brain\u2019s reflexes and activity- whether you are <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/gamification-study/left-brain-extrinsic-brain-intrinsic-core-drives-gamification/\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1;\">right brained or left brained</span></a>. In fact, you can go to some <a href=\"http://www.nodepositbonus.co.nz/\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1;\">no deposit bonus casinos</span></a> and start playing bingo right away without any money (or real money) on the internet!</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Talking more about the mental benefits of bingo, in the UK, tests have revealed that people who regularly play bingo score significantly higher on the mental ability tests. </span></p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">You\u2019ll often see these people exhibiting better mental speeds, better memory and better ability of picking information from their surroundings.</span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cYqB7o0IQf8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Bingo trains your brains!</span></h2>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Research has repeatedly revealed that playing bingo positively impacts the way in which brain processes information. The thinking capacity of humans declines gradually as they age, however studies have found that playing bingo can possibly counter this effect. The stimulation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2012/feb/23/brain-new-cells-adult-neurogenesis\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1;\">brain cells</span></a> caused by the game enables you to easily process and recall the stored information. </span></p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Furthermore, if you play the harder versions of the game, for instance 75 ball bingo that features more difficult patterns, it can further improve your mental abilities. Therefore, you might want to switch to the difficult bingo versions that you had been avoiding for so long!</span></p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Improves reaction times</span></h2>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Another significant area where bingo can help you get better at is your brain\u2019s reflexes. When you play this game you are required to remember the patterns and numbers within certain time limits. This can improve both the concentration as well as reaction time of your brain. Another similar game that has the same kind of impact is Sudoku.</span></p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Prevents cognitive disorders</span></h2>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Another bingo related benefit you should know about is that the mental stimulation caused by this game can help greatly in prevention of cognitive disorders like <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Alzheimers-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1;\">Alzheimer\u2019s</span></a> and dementia, at later stages of your life. Playing it regularly or even in short-bursts every now and then can both have a long-term therapeutic effect on your mind. </span></p>\n<h2><span lang=\"EN-GB\">But please don\u2019t become a bingo addict!</span></h2>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">However, please note, these facts aren\u2019t provided to make you start playing bingo at every living moment of your existence! Instead, you can consider playing this game for fun at least couple of times a week! Perhaps you could undergo a memory test before starting playing and then do another test after playing it regularly for a few months! </span></p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">After all, the best way to know the effectiveness of a method is by trying it first-hand!</span></p>\n",

Not for my sake but for yours), you might be a bit suprised why I chose Miles Dyson as the role model. It&#8217;s true, in a film that is action packed with robots killing each other with big weapons, Miles Dyson does play the role of the wimpy scientist that is powerless and unrespected.</p>\n<p>But if you looked deeper into his character, you&#8217;ll find that he is actually one of the most respectable people you may know.</p>\n<h3><!--more-->Miles Dyson is one of the smartest and richest men with a heart</h3>\n<p>To start off, Miles Bennett Dyson is one of the smartest people on the planet. He is the one that would create the super computer that would later become Skynet and the Terminators. He has ultimate science authority in Cyberdyne, is super rich (you can check out his big house/pool in the movie), and is completely passionate about what he&#8217;s working on, much like most entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Besides the brains and wealth, he is a man with a heart. There was shown a scene where his wife and kids wanted him to take them to Raging Waters, but he was glued onto his computer because he was &#8220;this close&#8221; to making the biggest technological breakthrough for mankind. After some loving patience from his wife, he was willing to stop working on it and take them out to play.</p>\n<p>Now I know for most people out there, what&#8217;s so special about taking a break from work and hanging out with your family on weekends? However, some of you may know that when you are working on a project/problem/startup that you are completely passionate about, it absorbs you into a totally different world that makes you think about it 24/7, and it&#8217;s difficult to keep your hands off the project. Miles Dyson was able to take a break from it because he truly loves his family. He is a package of brains and heart, wealth and respect. Life can&#8217;t get any better.</p>\n<h3>Yea he&#8217;s a cool guy. So what?</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the real story that makes me respect him. In the movie, Sarah Connor tries to kill him because she wants to prevent him from inventing Skynet in the future and destroying much of mankind. After being convinced of what she said was true (by seeing a real terminator), he IMMEDIATELY makes the determination that they must destroy his work. He tells them that they can&#8217;t just destroy his work at his house, they must go to the Cyberdyne headquarters and destroy everything there. He instantly makes a decision to drop his high status in society and become a criminal in order to save the future.</p>\n<p><strong>This ability to drop EVERYTHING and do what is right&#8230;THAT is respectable.</strong> He was just about to prove himself to be the top influential genius in the world with this thing he&#8217;s been working on day and night for over a decade, and once he realizes that this &#8220;could&#8221; destroy the future of mankind, he instantly decides to abandon all of it, including his life. That&#8217;s character right there.</p>\n<p>In the movie, after being shot at and explained why they wanted to kill him, he said, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m gonna throw up. You&#8217;re judging me on things I haven&#8217;t even done yet. How were we supposed to know?&#8221; as if in this moment the biggest concern of his is that his character has been personally insulted.</p>\n<p>And backing up that pride about his character, right after he knows it, he jumps to the conclusion: &#8220;There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to finish the new processor now. Forget it. I&#8217;m out of it. I&#8217;ll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow\u2026We&#8217;ll have to destroy all the stuff at the lab, the files, the disk drives and everything I have here. Everything.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Being smart or attractive is not based on your own merit, but doing what is right is</h3>\n<p>If I have been working on a truly world-changing startup for over ten years, and was on the verge of finishing it, and then suddenly a crazy woman tried to shoot me and tell me that it will destroy the future of mankind, even if I was convinced, I don&#8217;t know if I would be able to just drop everything and destroy it.</p>\n<p>Yes, a gun is pointing at me, but I might just pay lip service, or try to secretly keep a backup file for myself to use after this craziness. If anything, I would try to reason with myself, &#8220;the future was destroyed not because I invented this, but because it was put to wrong use. We can just stop the government from making the stupid decision on putting Skynet in charge of all the computers! Since I am the lead on this, I would be able to directly influence how it is used.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Whatever it is, I don&#8217;t know if I could do it as thoroughly as Miles Bennett Dyson. I might still destroy everything, but it will take me much longer to get to that conclusion, especially when it involves potentially risking my life.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the movie, when the Terminator was destroying everything, Miles Dyson asked the Terminator to pass up the axe (that was pretty much his only demand to the Terminator in the whole movie) because he wanted to destroy the main processor himself. Holding the axe, he says, &#8220;I spent so much time on this&#8230;&#8221; And then he goes full force into destroying it. You could see his hardened heart shatter to pieces while he is doing it, like a person who is killing his baby knowing the baby will grow up to destroy the world. How many people can do that?</p>\n<h3>What about you?</h3>\n<p>Do you have heroes that are non-intuitive and whom might surprise people? I&#8217;d love to hear about&#8217;em. Please share them in the comment section!</p>\n",

However, my personal experience is that it actually costs way more than doing it in the US if you are a resourceful entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are some firms out there that are truly good and cheap. I also know that there are way more US development firms that overcharge, but if you can find the cost efficient in the US, the effects are much better than the good in many foreign nations.</p>\n<p>This post is not about how the miscommunication, off hours and what not could make development more expensive. No, I&#8217;m talking about pure projected spending at the beginning. Here are my experiences:</p>\n<h3>Outsourcing to offshore teams I estimates takes 3x more hours than my in-house developer</h3>\n<p>There was one point where I seriously looked for an outsourced company as backbone developers for Viralogy. After looking around, I found a firm that seems really professional, has been around for close to a decase with dozens of engineers, and built all the websites for National Geographic in each country.</p>\n<p>More importantly, their programmers charge $10-15/hour. Compared to a full-blown traditional development firm in the US, that&#8217;s a tiny fraction of what it would cost. It all sounded very promising (besides a tiny bit of that language barrier).</p>\n<p>However, very safely, I asked them to do an estimate of a project that we were working on. My in-house programmer previously made an estimation, which was about 88 hours(which he didn&#8217;t exceed much afterwards). The foreign firm gave me an estimate too, and it was shockingly 350 hours.</p>\n<p>WHAT?</p>\n<p><!--more-->How could it be so different?</p>\n<p>After weighing the cost, we decided not to use them.</p>\n<h3>Another outsourced offshore firm is by far the best out of a dozen firms my friend worked with</h3>\n<p>Almost a year later, I was talking to a entrepreneur friend who seemed to have a lot of experience working as and with software engineers. He recommended me an Indian firm too. I told him about my last experience and I was skeptical about it.</p>\n<p>He told me that it&#8217;s normal that most of the offshore development firms are terrible and not well trained, but sometimes you can find that one good one that is just smack better than everyone else. He said he worked with over a dozen of them and finally found that one firm that is reliable and substantially stronger than the rest.</p>\n<p>I thought, hmm, well if a person has been through the trial and errors and found a good firm, then why not check them out.</p>\n<p>They told me they charged $18/hr. More expensive, but not mighty terrible. But from my last experience, I asked them to do an experimental project first.</p>\n<h3>Outsourced Firm II estimated a project to take 20x longer than my friend in the US</h3>\n<p>My friend wants to create a minimum barebones job listing site that is focused on startups called Mart of the Start, and asked me for help/reference. I looked at the screenshots and decided it was easy enough and could be finished within a week.</p>\n<p>I then forwarded these screenshots to the off-shored firm and asked them to first give me an estimate.</p>\n<p>Now I rarely get astonished, but this number pretty much astonished me.</p>\n<p><strong>215 hours.</strong></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s 215 hours x $18/hr = $3870.</p>\n<p>True, this is a relatively normal price for a full website, but like I said, this is a super simple website. I estimated this to take less than 5 hours for a really experienced web developer. The firm told me it would take 35 man days.</p>\n<p>OK, think that the project is harder than I believe it to be? After this offshored firm game me these numbers, I immediately referred my friend to another friend I have who I know is reliable and charges $25/hr.</p>\n<p>After looking at the project, <strong>my developer friend in the US said that he would charge around $200-300 and finish it over a weekend.</strong></p>\n<p>The funny thing is, after I told the offshored firm this and said that I can&#8217;t work with them, they said, &#8220;Thank you for the response. We however would like to mention that a test project just to check our coding capability can certainly reduce the efforts by around 50%.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Oh, now you realize I&#8217;m evaluating you and so your &#8220;efforts&#8221; can decrease by 50%? What is that? Also, even if they were 50% off, they were still ripping us off. And remember this is supposedly the good offshore firm that was WAY better than the other dozen that my friend worked with.</p>\n<h3>Still consider offshoring your development but be extra cautious</h3>\n<p>Again, I&#8217;m not saying all these firms are bad and would make you lose money. There are certainly firms in the US that charge $150/hr and would say it takes 100 hours to complete. There must be some good solid firms in various countries that would accelerate your business like no other.</p>\n<p>However, I want to remind all of you not to get fooled by the hourly rate they pose. Just because they are working from foreign countries and the hourly rate is low, doesn&#8217;t mean they are saving you money.</p>\n<p>Anyone else have experiences with outsourced development firms that you want to share (any country) so the rest can learn from?</p>\n",

If they like you, they are able to give you shootouts, advice, connections, and all that good stuff. However, it&#8217;s often very difficult to get their attention since they&#8217;re always bombarded with all sorts of things.</span></h3>\n<p>Twitter creates that opportunity for you to contact them instantly. But still, you&#8217;ve tweeted out to them before, and either they completely ignored you, or they responded back, made you feel great, and you know they forgot about you right after.</p>\n<h3>Engage <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">your followers</span> those you follow</h3>\n<p>Most advice out there tell you to engage your followers. I can&#8217;t agree more with that. However, if you want to get non-followers to know who you are (read: not to &#8220;follow&#8221; you), you&#8217;ll need to do more than that.</p>\n<p><!--more-->Based on some of my own experiences on Twitter, I learned a few things that can get peoples&#8217; attention on it. With a bit over 20,000 followers, I&#8217;m definitely not a web celebrity or a big time influencer(they&#8217;re usually in the millions), but it is still impractical for me to really know everyone on my list. But there are somehow some folks that I&#8217;ve seen over and over again that I just feel I know them in some way, even when I know absolutely nothing about them besides they respond to my tweets or retweet me every once in a while.</p>\n<p>These are people who go on my radar on a regular basis, although I don&#8217;t talk to them much. As time goes by, I become more and more familiar to them. It&#8217;s interesting, because I don&#8217;t even necessarily like them (some of them are kinda rude to others), but when they ask me for help, I usually follow through and do it for them. I feel like they are my Twitter friends, despite the lack of past communication.</p>\n<p>A while ago, one of them for some reason stopped tweeting me. I didn&#8217;t really notice that he stopped when it happened, but after a few months, he retweeted me again. When I saw it, I thought, &#8220;Oh yea! This guy! I haven&#8217;t seen him for such a long time!&#8221; and so I tweeted him and asked how he was doing. We still don&#8217;t talk much, but I&#8217;m definitely part of his resources now. Out of all my followers, this guy was able to build implicit friendship with me with just a few tweets here and there.</p>\n<p>If you are consistently and persistently there for someone, you can become his/her friend.</p>\n<h3>Getting tweets is not annoying because people are not EXPECTED to respond</h3>\n<p>A lot of people would ask, &#8220;Well, wouldn&#8217;t it be really annoying if I keep tweeting them, when they don&#8217;t even want to respond?&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s sometimes true for email, but on Twitter as long as you are saying appropriate and relevant things, people don&#8217;t mind. The difference between Twitter and email here is that in emails, people are expected to respond to you.\u00a0This creates some implicit pressure and annoyance when you are constantly sending them something.</p>\n<p>But in Twitter, oftentimes a response to their witty comment or expression of gratitude does not give people this kind of pressure. They simply feel that their tweet is getting more responses from others and will probably feel good about themselves.</p>\n<p>This is the same philosophy as constantly commenting on other blogs. If you do it once, it&#8217;s almost as if you haven&#8217;t done anything. But if you are always there commenting whenever someone has a new post, you will be discovered. Like right now Johann Ly can ask me any favor and I&#8217;ll probably say yes \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t worry about annoying people (obviously don&#8217;t tweet them 20 times in one day). Just stay persistent and good things will come.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Here are 7 steps to \u00a0become known by influencers:</span></p>\n<h3>Step 1: Make sure your Twitter Icon is distinctive</h3>\n<p>You should have nailed this by now. Most people on Twitter identify you as your little icon instead of your name. Your image needs to stand out from the rest so that people make no mistake if they have talked to you before. I purposely made my <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yukai_chou\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter icon</a> more &#8220;digitalized&#8221; with the white background so it&#8217;s easily recognizable when people see it. If you haven&#8217;t even nailed down this part, you should check out one of my most popular posts: <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/social-media/start-settle-fall-love-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Start, Settle, and Fall in Love with Twitter.</a></p>\n<h3>Step 2: Follow the Lists of people you want to connect with</h3>\n<p>This is the important part. Once you know who you want to meet (famous investors, programmers, retail company accounts etc etc), you should either put together your own &#8220;awesome people I want to meet&#8221; list, or go on sites like <a href=\"http://listorious.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Listorious</a> to find that group of people. Try to only focus on a handful of groups because the purpose of using lists is to narrow it down to a manageable amount of people that you can actually engage and build relationships with. Follow the list through Twitter so it can be piped into your apps.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Setup the lists as columns in your computer Twitter Clients</h3>\n<p>Once the lists is added onto Twitter, you should create a column for each list in your computer Twitter Client such as <a href=\"http://seesmic.com\" target=\"_blank\">Seesmic</a>, <a href=\"http://tweetdeck.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetdeck</a>, or <a href=\"http://hootsuite.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hootsuite</a>. They all offer tools that help you import lists and engage with them. Make sure that the column is at a place that you will easily see on a daily basis, instead of hidden somewhere so you&#8217;ll be reminded to do this often.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Setup the lists as columns on your mobile Twitter Client</h3>\n<p>Besides setting the lists up on your computer, you also want to make sure you set it up on your mobile apps. I personally feel that Tweetdeck is the best on the iPhone(though I don&#8217;t like it as much on the desktop) because it allows you to store/view multiple lists very easily.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Devote 15 minutes a day to respond to and retweet everyone on the list</h3>\n<p>After you have it set up on your Desktop/Web client, try to devote 15 minutes everyday to engage the people on the list. Retweet what they say <strong>with a few words before it</strong> (like &#8220;That IS pretty funny! RT @cow&#8230;.&#8221;)\u00a0, respond to things they say, and cheer them on when appropriate. The point is that you don&#8217;t even need to say anything intellectual. You can just say, &#8220;Good luck with your meeting!&#8221; or &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s pretty amazing!&#8221; &#8220;Thanks for sharing the link&#8221; and that&#8217;s all fine. The point is to get them to see you icon on a regular basis, even if they ignore you.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Engage your Follow Lists through mobile whenever you are waiting for something</h3>\n<p>Do the exact same thing when you are outdoors waiting for something. If you are waiting in line, on the bus, at a meeting where the other person is late, just take out your mobile phone and tweet away. You want to be there as much as you can. I actually never feel bored anymore when I&#8217;m waiting for something since I really just tweet away (even when I&#8217;m waiting for food to be served in a fast-food place). Before doing this, I would only tweet out once, then respond to a few @ messages, maybe check out a few interesting trends or keywords, but really most of it is just finding something to do but not necessarily productive. This makes life more interesting.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Do this continuously until the people recognize your name and start to respond to you</h3>\n<p>After you do this for awhile, people will start noticing you. By then, when you actually need some help, you have a good chance of receiving by just tweeting them, &#8220;Hey, I was wondering if you could help out and share this&#8221; or &#8220;Hey, I have some questions regarding ecommerce sites. Is it possible to ask you some questions?&#8221; If they actively remember you retweeting their stuff and responding to them whenever they are sharing their feelings, you have good odds of this going through.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you want to think of them as real friends instead of &#8220;targets.&#8221; However, since you had no chance of becoming friends naturally, it&#8217;s useful to apply strategies to build genuine relationships. When a guy&#8217;s pursuing a girl, he&#8217;s looking for a genuine relationship, but he&#8217;s also gotta be a little tactful and shrewd to stand out from all the other men who are trying to get her attention.</p>\n<h3>What are other ways to meet people that are usually too busy to talk to you?</h3>\n<p>Have you ever tried out other ways to make important and busy people talk to you besides the typical cold email or getting referrals? It would be awesome if you can share it in the comments so everyone can learn.</p>\n",

It seemed like I could hold very sophisticated conversations with people twice (and sometimes thrice) my age, and end up in a situation where both sides learned something valuable. My honest answer to them is, &#8220;I drive a lot.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;.what does driving a lot have anything to do with being knowledgeable or being a good leader? Isn&#8217;t driving just a waste of time?</p>\n<p>The answer is podcasts.</p>\n<p>Upon retrospection, a majority of my knowledge and education actually came from business or industry podcasts. I can seriously say that I have learned more useful things from my podcasts than my 3 years of studying International Economics at UCLA. I also learned a lot by reading books, blogposts and articles online, but they had high opportunity costs and I couldn&#8217;t afford to do it on a daily basis due to the scarcity of time.</p>\n<p>However, podcasts are great because you can be doing all kinds of stuff while listening to them. You could be working out, waiting for a friend, shopping, or you could just be driving around. You can be doing all these mundane tasks, but at the same time, absorb world class information and knowledge.</p>\n<p><!--more-->The nice thing about these podcasts is that they are a compilation of decades of experience and tons of research, all condensed into a 20-60 min blast. In some podcasts, successful entrepreneurs let you know what are the most valuable lessons they have learned in the past 20 years in 60 minutes. In others, you have Partners at large consulting firms discuss all the cutting edge topics in the industry, backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars in research. If you absorb all this over an hour a day while working out or doing mundane tasks for 5 years, there is no way you won&#8217;t become more enlightened and speak beyond your age. So in essence, you don&#8217;t need to be smart. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">You just need to be a medium of VERY good information.</span></p>\n<p>This is like a RPG game where you can learn skills that are always working without you clicking on them (gamers call it Passive Skills). Passive skills are ideal because you can only use 1-3 active skills at once, but if you want, you can activate 20 passive skills at once and it helps your quest-conquering without disrupting your usual behavior. Yes, I understand some of you prefer to listen to music while doing those mundane tasks, but listening to music probably won&#8217;t make you a better person 5 years later. Listening to educational podcasts will.</p>\n<p>After going through dozens and dozens of podcasts, here are some that I feel are the best, both in being informative and being interesting. Keep in mind the best way to get them is to search them on itunes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought Leadership Series:</a> This is one of the best podcasts I&#8217;ve listened to. Successful entrepreneurs like the founder of Palm, IDEO, Facebook, LinkedIN, Mozilla and tons of others come to talk about the most valuable lessons they have learned throughout their entrepreneurial experience. Entrepreneurs are pretty dynamic people, so the tone is really interesting and engaging. The stories are exciting, and the audio quality is very high. Most importantly, the lessons taught are invaluable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mixergy.com/interviews/\" target=\"_blank\">Mixergy:</a> This is probably the most USEFUL podcast for entrepreneurs. Andrew Warner is a friend of mine (but I am in no way biased) and makes sure that his audience learns HOW successful entrepreneurs build their businesses. Instead of focusing on big generic concepts that&#8217;s always about &#8220;get a good team&#8221;, &#8220;be passionate&#8221;, Andrew digs deep into the interview and finds out exactly how these entrepreneurs do things tactically. His goal is that after the interview, everyone should be able to do the exact thing. 100% recommended here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hbsp.libsyn.com/rss\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Ideacast</a>: This podcast discusses some cutting edge topics on leadership, particularly relating to running a large organization. It also talks about new trends like Going Green, Business Ethics, and some times gives you interesting Case Studies. People tend to have interesting personalities and its pretty engaging.</p>\n<p>Business Success Tips: This is the podcast I listen to when I am taking a break from intensive learning or when I&#8217;m down. This is actually one of the funniest podcasts I have ever heard. It is a clear example of being FD &#8211; combining work and play. A group of successful small business consultants and entrepreneurs gather together over some wine, and talk about anything they care about. A lot of bashing and not necessarily politically correct (they claim they have no more female listeners), but you do learn a lot and get tons of fun from it. What&#8217;s impressive is that they have one of the best sound qualities because Lee and Andy are awesome tech guys (and Paul likes to buy the coolest gear).<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wsjradio.com/WSJAM.html\" target=\"_blank\"><br />\nWall Street Journal This Morning:</a> This is the best &#8220;getting updated with everything that is going on&#8221; podcast I have heard. They record one every morning talking about the latest news in the business and tech world. They&#8217;re usually a bit long (45min) for a quick morning update, but they are also pretty entertaining and have good music that goes along with it. I usually catch up with 1-2 episodes every week to make sure I know what is going on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.talkshoe.com/talkshoe/web/talkCastCustomAds.jsp?masterId=13431&amp;cmd=tc\" target=\"_blank\">Entrepreneurship and Business Course:</a> This is the best podcast on entrepreneurship that explains everything you need to know about how to create a startup step-by-step. This is actually based on a real course on entrepreneurship in Carnegie Mellon. Professor Juliano is an interesting person but he can be somewhat dull. The good thing is that he really likes explaining so you will get a complete set of knowledge with this. The title is not very creative though.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ksmediaserver.net/ftp/Podcasting/MoF.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Mckinsey Finance Podcast:</a> This is a high quality podcast that talks about Finance and how to make sure an organization runs well. They talk about things like Return on Investment, Six Sigma and all that good stuff. The sound quality of the podcast is disappointedly bad, and they make some mistakes in editing. Furthermore, they speak in a very dull and non-engaging fashion because they need to be &#8220;professional.&#8221; Still, good content if you are wide awake and is excited about the topic enough to take these 20 min shorter blasts.</p>\n<p>Deloitte Insight: This is a podcast that covers large industry topics. What executives and managers are worried about, and how to run a company more efficiently. Deloitte has high competency in Management, IT, and Human Resource, as well as Risk Management. This is a great podcast to be aware of what are the big issues on the 5 year horizon. They talk about things like the Global Shortage of Talent and how to make sure your digital files are secure. The problem with this podcast is again its incredibly boring, or &#8220;professional.&#8221; Everyone speaks in a monotonous fashion, and the laughs sound forced and awkward. Also, each episode is 60 min so you will learn that you can only stand topics that you are already very passionate about.</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Chou-Side-head.jpg\"></a></h3>\n<h3>Long time no blog</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I updated my blog. Things have been crazy for me as I have experienced some of the most challenging events in my life in 2010. I have been extremely busy due to Viralogy and some personal issues, so I haven&#8217;t been able to write much. However, every time I check <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Google Analytics\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics\">Google Analytics</a> I still see that a good chunk of my daily traffic is from Direct Traffic (meaning people typed in &#8220;http:yukaichou.com&#8221; in their URL bars). If you found my site because you clicked on a link or searched for some content, that is fine. But for those who make an effort to see if there&#8217;s anything new I have to say, I do feel apologetic for disappointing you in the past 6 months. I owe an update to you. I&#8217;ll try to share as much as I can about everything that is going on in my life, but some things are truly quite personal so I&#8217;ll keep it somewhat vague.</p>\n<h3>Ending of a relationship</h3>\n<p>Personal life in 2010 has mostly been slumpy. My beloved girlfriend of two years and I broke up due to the long distance and some differences in values. The break up itself was somewhat smooth, but the aftermath became very ugly. I thought I would be okay and can simply focus on work, but it simply devastated me. For the first time in my life I told my team that I needed some time off. I thought a week would be enough, but the effects of having someone you loved very deeply attack you for no reason hurts &#8211; really really badly. I&#8217;ve never really experienced this in my life, but it felt like there was a fire burning in my head, vaporizing my thoughts. I couldn&#8217;t really think, and I could barely feel. All there was was this burning burning burning in the head. Breathing kinda sucked, and my sight was darkened. Yes, it seems like this is something you read in novels, but that&#8217;s really how I felt&#8230;.for 30 minute durations during those bad moments. For being known as one of the most emotionally stable person among my friends, this was quite new to me. I DO NOT want to have this feeling ever again in my life.</p>\n<h3>Family Stuff</h3>\n<p>At the exact same time, I went through one of the most trying times I&#8217;ve had in my family. Since this is very personal and highly related to my family members, I won&#8217;t share much. Just know that there were dark moments where I couldn&#8217;t see any hope, and I was required to take the role of  moderating what I didn&#8217;t want to see happen. Luckily, this issue turned out alright a few months later, but the process was quite draining indeed.</p>\n<p>Shortly after, I learned that my grandfather unexpectedly passed away. He was 92 and lived a good life, but it was still a huge shame that I couldn&#8217;t see him as his only grandson for the past 4 years due to Taiwan&#8217;s military draft. I learned that he called out for my name multiple times in his hospital bed, and was disappointed when I wasn&#8217;t there. Fortunately, due to new regulations in Taiwan, I was allowed to visit Taiwan for two weeks and attend his funeral (I am in Taiwan right now writing this).</p>\n<p>What made me very sad about the situation is my grandmother. She is 82, and despite having a very healthy body, she has some memory issues. She keeps on forgetting and relearning/reexperiencing my grandfather&#8217;s death. Sometimes she would notice something and ask, &#8220;Did your grandfather pass away?&#8221; I would tell her he passed away two weeks ago. She would then react in devastation and say, &#8220;How come I didn&#8217;t know this? How come no one told me?&#8221; and then start to cry. I have never seen my grandmother cry before this.</p>\n<p>What makes things worse, is that the government is taking away her house that she has been living in for sixty years. These houses were giving to veterans in the early days, and now the government plans to rebuild them into high-rise apartments for the private sector. Of course the government is compensating my grandmother for a new place to live, but having such big changes in her life can really be detrimental to her emotional health. Especially with her memory issue, it would be pretty awful if she suddenly forgets where she is at and think she is being kidnapped by her helper that she has never seen before. I wish I could help more but I still have my residency status problems that wipe me of the stability I need to take care of people.</p>\n<h3>International Status</h3>\n<p>Speaking of that (okay, I promise I am close to finishing my list of complaints :P), my international status has truly been a pain in the butt for me. Because I don&#8217;t have citizen or green card status for the US nor Canada, my company can make money, but it cannot pay me a salary since all income opportunities should be reserved for citizens. My status does not even qualify for a McDonald&#8217;s job to support my living and can only hangout with my savings as she continues to lose weight (although sometimes family members and occasional speaking/consulting gigs would feed her). Even more ridiculous is that I need to enroll in local colleges to ensure I have status in this country. Being an entrepreneur without income is tough enough. Now try paying worthless tuition (need full-time status) and spending useless time for classes I don&#8217;t need in a local college, despite having a decent degree from UCLA. Do that for three years, and it&#8217;s understandable that it&#8217;s relatively hard to be the one that is always positive and bringing everyone up in difficult situations.</p>\n<p>An interesting note is that, my case is so extreme that I received a call from the  New York Mayor&#8217;s office and they wanted to use me as a great case study to push through the new Startup Visa regulation. &#8220;Look how sucky this guy&#8217;s life is trying to make this country better. We need new laws!&#8221; It is quite sad being in a country that doesn&#8217;t want you there to create jobs and innovation, but instead strips away your rights as a basic human being.</p>\n<h3>New Relationship</h3>\n<p>On a brighter side, I have a new girlfriend now. I met her at church in the SF Bay Area and we love each other very dearly and passionately. It&#8217;s still early in the relationship so it&#8217;s hard to make any final conclusions, but so far it seems like we both know how to appreciate each others&#8217; best qualities. We really make each other better.</p>\n<p>The only problem is, my mother completely dislikes her and says she will never accept my new girlfriend, mostly because my girlfriend is significantly older than I am. Lets just say she is 10-15 years older than I am, towards the less conservative side. Yea, it&#8217;s okay to gasp right now. I understand \ud83d\ude42 But I really didn&#8217;t know our age difference was that huge. I thought she was 4-5 years older than I was, and she thought I was maybe 4-5 years younger than her. When I found out our age differences, we were already kinda together and I truly truly like who she is, so I decided that who she is was more important than her age.</p>\n<p>She does look pretty young (as well as her personality), as most of my friends guess that she is 27-29. This elder lady in her 60s even thought we were the same age. I understand that one day she will grow and look older, but I think love is more than that. Can a man love an unattractive woman? Of course! Can a man continue to love a woman after she gains 30lbs? Of course. As an entrepreneur, I go for the optimistic outcome, no matter how unlikely, but am ready to take responsibility for the decisions I make in my life.</p>\n<h3>Some challenges</h3>\n<p>But my parents don&#8217;t think so. I&#8217;ve gotten into so many fights with my mother because of this, to the extent that she&#8217;s on the merge of disowning me. Needlesstosay, this has been rather disheartening too. I understand where she is coming from, as most parents wouldn&#8217;t accept this, but I also think that I should be the one that decides who I love and who I want to spend the rest of my life with, not someone else. Luckily, Angel also understands my mother&#8217;s position and have been patiently supporting me emotionally on all battlefields in my life. We have both been praying patiently for this.</p>\n<p>Of course, another issue is timing. I would like to have kids one day. However, if I wait it out till I feel like everything is ready, she might not be at the right age for that anymore. Of course I&#8217;m not going to be the type that marries a women he meets in Las Vegas 24 hours prior. We would still want to wait a couple years. I just can&#8217;t wait for 5-7 years before we get married. Hopefully in this time period, people around would slowly accept our situation instead of disdain it. It would suck if my parents do not show up at my wedding.</p>\n<h3>Misc info</h3>\n<p>Hmmm, other random questions you might have on your mind: No, she has not married before and does not have kids. She did not marry because she was in a 7-year relationship that didn&#8217;t pan out, and before that a 4-year relationship that didn&#8217;t pan out. She is Taiwanese (just like me), is a working professional in San Francisco and has a very stable lifestyle. She also loves the Lord more than anything else and she makes me a better Christian. She is okay that I&#8217;m an entrepreneur. I interact with her the same way I interact with any past girlfriends, and nothing is unnatural.</p>\n<p>I know this is a very gossip-worthy topic, and being open as I am (that&#8217;s what I teach in social media, after all), I can&#8217;t stop people who know me from talking about this. But I do ask this: please don&#8217;t make any assumptions about who she is, who I am, or the reasons why we are together. I already know this is going to be a less than smooth path, and people will says things that are unkind and inaccurate, but I would appreciate you as my friend or blog reader not being in that group.</p>\n<h3>Work</h3>\n<p>Work has actually been pretty good for me in 2010. My company has had more progress than any other year in the past. We have started to attract more customers, investors are getting more interested as we move forward in our fundraising goals, and the team is finally full-time together. I also got invited to be a small guest lecturer at a course in Stanford early next year, which is definitely pretty neat. Obviously there&#8217;s still struggles every week and new crisis to manage all the time, but all in all, the company is in great shape and we are looking to make our mark in this world as entrepreneurs and innovators.</p>\n<h3>Being a hero</h3>\n<p>Another interesting event is that my previous chess student from years back wrote me an email saying he has a school assignment that requires him to interview someone he considers his hero. He wanted to interview me. Naturally that made me feel pretty good. He sent me over a dozen questions, and the first one read, &#8220;Have you ever saved a life? If so, how?&#8221; Wow, this school assignment sure has some high prerequisites for being a hero. Luckily, it turns out that I have saved a life before. Once I wrote a blogpost on Asian culture, and unexpectedly a reader emailed me and told me on which exact date he attempted suicide in the past but failed. He was then going to do his second attempt, but decided to go online for some answers before doing it. He stumbled upon my blog, and some how it made him decide not to end his life anymore. This was years back, and we still stay in touch today. So thank you blog for giving me the opportunity to do this and not fail my chess student&#8217;s interview! I wish I had more time to update this blog.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This is probably the only blogpost I wrote that focuses on my personal life way more than my work. Before I view my blog as sharing my professional experiences and knowledge (if you call it that) to help others. When I&#8217;m busy, I feel like all my &#8220;working time&#8221; needs to be devoted to running the business instead, especially when what I do is already hard to appreciate. But for this post, I guess I treat it like sharing my thoughts and feelings with my personal friends. This post is more for me than anyone else.</p>\n<p>After all of this, I am still the same person. I will still work with much hope and optimism. I will still always be there for friends and strangers who need me. I will continue to do my best to create value and bring innovation to this world.

That&#8217;s basically teaching people how to become powerful in whatever fields they are in and things they care about. It is similar to the common Life Coaching, but more geared towards ambitious individuals who does not just want to live a comfortable and stable life but want to become the best in what they do and become influential and impactful in this world.</p>\n<p>This would be an extension to the Lifestyle Gamification\u00a0concepts\u00a0that I created in 2005. (Check <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/social-media/video-posted-fd-lifestyle-presentation-google/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to see my presentation at Google on it)</p>\n<h3>Is Power Bad?</h3>\n<p>I first want to make a disclaimer that &#8220;Power&#8221; has a slightly negative connotation, as people say &#8220;power corrupts&#8221; and how the rule of nature is the &#8220;powerful exploiting the weak.&#8221; However, I believe power itself is neutral.</p>\n<p>Power just allows one to make something happen, so it could be used to do extreme good, or extreme evil. In the context of this blog, Power simply means being resourceful and influential enough to create an impact in whatever you care about.</p>\n<p>Finally, since I like to draw analogies from the gaming world to this world, Power is just a common phrase in being really strong at something (and isn&#8217;t that where a lot of passions lie? Many people couldn&#8217;t do what they want in the real world so they decide to be a hero in a virtual world).</p>\n<p>Again, I am not teaching you how to gain &#8220;freedom&#8221; or create passive income that allows you to chill at the beach all day. Sure, these would be very useful in becoming powerful, but that&#8217;s not the end goal. The goal is not to let you live a &#8220;free&#8221; life but to let you live a &#8220;fulfilling&#8221; life. It&#8217;s the life of &#8220;With great power, comes great responsibilities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you were playing a game and you had absolute &#8220;freedom&#8221; in running around, going to town, the fields, eat and buy stuff, but you don&#8217;t have a mission, would that be fulfilling? Probably not.</p>\n<p>This blog will be about how to beat the game.</p>\n<h3><!--more-->5 Ultimate Stats to Lifestyle Gamification</h3>\n<p>In my system, there are 5 Stats in measuring how powerful a person is:</p>\n<p>1) Connections<br />\n2) Reputation<br />\n3) Influence<br />\n4) Resources<br />\n5) Ability</p>\n<p>Often times, the steps to increase these stats are different in different fields and careers, but there are a lot of overlapping. I&#8217;ll be talking a lot about examples in business field, entrepreneurship, technology, and social media since I&#8217;ve been in these things for the longest, but most of these principles can be applied to other fields too.</p>\n<h3>Some past articles that relate to Lifestlye Gamification</h3>\n<p>Here are some good blog posts that are good starters to for the FD Power Coaching Series.</p>\n<p>For a Strategy Roadmap, these are the <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/philosophy/how-to-start-the-fd-lifestyle/\" target=\"_blank\">Four Steps to Power up Through Lifestyle Gamification</a></p>\n<p>1) Determining the Game you are Playing (Find out the industry you are passionate about)<br />\n2) Determine your role in the game by knowing your initial stats and playing style (Find out your specialization from your strengths and your interests)<br />\n3) Plan out a Skillset Growth Road Map (Think about what skill set combinations you need to master to accomplish your goals)<br />\n4) Find Teammates that can help you along in your journey and conquer easy quests.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/philosophy/outside-the-comfort-zone-the-harmless-dragon/\" target=\"_blank\">Outside the Comfort Zone: The Harmless Dragon</a> (There&#8217;s nothing you can lose by taking initiative)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/chou/6-core-values-of-fd-networking/\" target=\"_blank\">The 6 Cores of FD Networking</a> (Integrity, Sincerity, Optimism, Confidence, Initiative, Persistence)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/life-lessons/persistence-failing-success/\" target=\"_blank\">Persistent: Failing your way to Success</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/entrepreneurship/impress-driving/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Impress everyone by just driving around</a> (use your time efficiently and listen to podcasts)</p>\n<p>How to become successful without an impressive image</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/reputation/reputation-deal-bashers/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Deal with Bashers</a> (Fully engage them with full politeness and reason until they feel they are ridiculous themselves)</p>\n",

At least my bank uses the format 1990-1999 and 2000-2009 to determine one period. Perhaps if I failed on my goals this year, next year I will say &#8220;NOW is the beginning of the new decade. ROAR!!&#8221;</p>\n<p>But lets hope not.</p>\n<p>THIS is going to be the year. This is going to be the year where I straighten out everything in my life, where I finally launch the long-boiled fleet of Carriers, D-Web enabled Corsairs, handful of Arbiters, and of course a couple observers.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to make a &#8220;New Years Resolution.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think they really get met much. It&#8217;s more like a joke that appends &#8220;expected to fail and renewed the year after&#8221; (and I do have high respect for those who actually meet their NYR for an entire year). Instead, I will create principles of how I should live my life in 2010, a &#8220;plan&#8221; or &#8220;strategy&#8221; on how to become a stronger character on my server, conquer harder quests, and beat the game of life.</p>\n<p>Here are the things that I think are essential in 2010 for me to convert all the things that I have built up to into actual success:</p>\n<h3>2010 is the Year of Hustle</h3>\n<p>I like to think through a lot of things, contemplate how everything comes together, see trends, match personalities and parties, and analyze everything on each step while I am taking actioning. As a result, my execution might be slower than it could be. This is the year where I WILL improve my execution and hustling. After all, in our industry the first to market usually does not produce winners. It&#8217;s the ones that execute the best that are the winners.</p>\n<h3><!--more-->2010 is the Year of Accountability</h3>\n<p>Since I run a virtual team of around 12 people, accountability can be an issue as small things might slip through without anyone making a big deal about it. This WILL change in 2010. I say this not only for myself but for my entire team that I am leading. Everyone&#8217;s action items will be very clear, and if it is not met, everyone else should know and the person needs to catch up with progress. Even if people are working for free, if they can&#8217;t stay accountable and reliable with their tasks, I would rather have a smaller team of consistent people than a large team of unreliable people.</p>\n<h3>2010 is the Year of Discipline</h3>\n<p>There are many things in my life that I need to be more disciplined for. My Faith, my relationship, my health, friendship and things I enjoy doing. I realized that the only way that I can have a more &#8220;balanced&#8221; life is to live more disciplined in my choices. I WILL spend more time in my Faith, optimize my time in my relationship, make healthy choices that does not use up more time, cut down on sleep but stabilize on the hours, help out friends more but hang out less, and cut down on unproductive entertainment that will not matter 5 years from now.</p>\n<p>In order to afford being an entrepreneur, extreme discipline is required. I will live my life as a Productivity Artist, carving out a new masterpiece in the form of days that I cannot be more productive in, day by day.</p>\n<h3>2010 is the Year of Cashflow</h3>\n<p>As a startup, we&#8217;re always weaker on cashflow. In 2009, we have nailed down some good models and have cash streaming into the business. However, most people are still underpaid and most money still is poured into operations. In 2010, we WILL scale out our revenue and generate enough cashflow for everyone in the company to earn what they deserve and be able to produce more value for the company. In 2010, we will make both our fundraising and revenue goals and become a strong company.</p>\n<h3>2010 is the Year of the Visa</h3>\n<p>This is only my special situation. Being an entrepreneur is hard enough with many risks and limitations. However, the mere fact that I was born in a different country prevents me from creating the maximum value I can for my company. There are numerous ways I can &#8220;hang around&#8221; in the states, but none of them are ideal and they cost me an unfair amount of money.</p>\n<p>When I&#8217;m in the states, my own company cannot pay me (besides the &#8220;returning&#8221; of the invested/lent money in the company before), but once I leave this country, I can get paid again. So in order to get paid by startups, foreign-born talents need to leave the country and spend their income dollars somewhere else. How does that make sense? I mean, 20 years ago when the laws were set, it was true that if foreigns aren&#8217;t around, you would pay locals instead. But nowadays you will pay high-skilled technology foreigners anyway, except they will not spend the money locally and local talents won&#8217;t get that extra income.</p>\n<p>There are two ways that I see this happening. One is that Viralogy will be making so much money in 2010 that it can sponsor me and pay me a &#8220;competitive executive salary&#8221; (which for a startup is usually not a good business move). On the other hand, there seems to be a New Entrepreneur Visa that is being debated in Congress. If I get one of those, I am sure that I will be able to bring Viralogy into new grounds that change the industry while creating hundreds of new jobs.</p>\n<p>Right now I operate from Canada and visit Silicon Valley for 3 weeks every two months. If I don&#8217;t resolve this issue in the next few years, I will need to return to Taiwan and do my military services, which would be somewhat unfortunate for an entrepreneur. Lets get this out of the way in 2010.</p>\n<h3>The Future for my Personal Blog Yukaichou.com</h3>\n<p>I have also been thinking about what to do with my blog. I&#8217;ve built many friendship through it, and even found clients, employees, and mentees from it. However, my schedule forces me to not update it as much as I had hoped. Unlike my co-founder Jun Loayza, I&#8217;m not very good at writing shorter posts. Somehow I have to elaborate on everything and leave nothing in the air.</p>\n<p>However, when it comes to not writing at all vs spending less time for a shorter post regularly, I think updating the blog regularly is more important. I&#8217;m hoping that I can maintain a blog like Seth Godin, with 1-2 paragraphs of daily nuggets (except mine won&#8217;t be golden) to keep my readers engaged and keep a conversation going.</p>\n<p>Also, I&#8217;ve been debating about the theme my blog will take in 2010. I&#8217;m stuck between three. For one, I would really like to give my analysis and &#8220;outsights&#8221; for my expertise in Social Media, since that is what my company does and would probably best align my personal brand with Viralogy. However, I personally am very interested in bringing out the potential of individuals and making them successful, so I would want to write about Power Coaching and help ambitious individuals master their lives in everything they do with lessons and analogies from Gaming. And finally, I also want to have a Gen-Y Leadership blog, talking about my experiences, lessons, and reminders for being a strong Gen-Y Leader, since it is a niche that I think should have more coverage.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still contemplating which direction I should take, but I definitely feel a stronger focus on my blog would be beneficial. Either way, I hope the blog will continue to be fun and educational at the same time.</p>\n<h3>2010: the year of Legacy</h3>\n<p>I am committed to make 2010 a year where I make things happen. You know how people can recite the year of when historically significant events happen? 2010 is the best year to create something like that, if only because the year is a lot easier to remember \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I will leave no regrets this year. Please make 2010 the year where you follow your passions too.</p>\n",

The problem is that we have too many blindspots for ourselves to really find out what we really need to work on. When something goes wrong, we can think of a hundred external factors for that reason, but we genuinely cannot see our own faults.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And when it comes down to it, most people WANT to know their flaws that they don&#8217;t see themselves. The problem is, it&#8217;s considered impolite for people to tell you of your faults when it is not completely necessary. Most people are non-confrontational, and not everyone takes criticism constructively.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Use the magic mirror around you</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The solution to this? Just ask. I have experienced and seen numerous times when someone randomly asks, \u201cWhat can I do to improve myself?\u201d And immediately, almost without thinking, people give the asker a very constructive list of things they can work on. It&#8217;s like they&#8217;ve been thinking about it all along but never felt comfortable enough to share it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By asking this very simple question often, you will constantly find things you are blinded by and can improve on. This works especially well when you ask people who can benefit from your improvement (like being more considerate to loved ones, setting more accountability for the team).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For instance, if the Queen from Snow White had a magic mirror as good as the &#8220;straight-forward friend&#8221;, the mirror would tell her that her problem is not that she&#8217;s not fair enough, but &#8220;You are too vain, self-conscious, and jealous of others. You can never be happy if you can&#8217;t accept yourself. You should just be happy with who you are and love life.&#8221; I consider that an infinitely better solution than trying to poison an innocent girl to death.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Set up Mirror Alerts</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Often times, even after we know we need to improve something, it&#8217;s never instant, and we usually make the same mistakes over and over without realizing it. So after you know what you need to improve on, a good follow up is, \u201cThanks! Can you remind me every time I do that again? Sometimes I&#8217;m not aware of it&#8230;\u201d And now you gave people the permission to harass you whenever you screw up. Pretty awesome.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What straight-forward advice have you gotten from friends, or one&#8217;s you have given to friends?</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Reading is good, but socializing is more fun! I look forward to your ideas and experiences in the comment section!</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<h3>Trickle Up Stimulus Optimization Theory</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to give you what I believe is the best strategy for Stimulus Optimization, and then layout the logic that got me to my conclusion. (Note: since we&#8217;re talking about an economy at large, I&#8217;ll be doing a lot of generalizing for demographics. I obviously know not ALL people in that demographic are like that).</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Money should stay circulated in old lower income males, small businesses (but not large corporations), social enterprises and non-profits.<br />\n<strong>2.</strong> Money should be put into industry-creating technologies, but not just for technology development but also the commercialization of the technology.<a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/society/government-pay-entrepreneurs-salaries-save-economy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> The government should support tons of startup entrepreneurs but pay them just enough for them to survive</a>.<br />\n<strong>3.</strong> Money should be put into essentials of society like Education, Healthcare and Tech Infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Some of this may seem unintuitive, or possibly biased/humanitarian, but I do believe that this is most economically efficient. Let me explain why.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>Underlying Principles</h3>\n<p>So my theory is derived from the following principles:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> The economy is maintained based on money flowing from one person to another.<br />\n<strong>2.</strong> When someone has money, they spend a certain amount and save a certain amount, creating a spend/save ratio for each individual.<br />\n<strong>3.</strong> If everyone is frightened and saves, the economy will become worse because no one spends and no one makes income.<br />\n<strong>4.</strong> As a result, money must go through the people who have the highest spend/save ratios and extend to as many nodes in that group as possible.<br />\n<strong>5.</strong> Technology advancements create new industries and provides thousands of new jobs. More than 20% of the jobs today didn&#8217;t exist 20 years ago.<br />\n<strong>6.</strong> For the US to stay strong, it should take the actions of which made poor countries rich.<br />\n<strong>7.</strong> There are some things that MUST be there for a country to function, such as healthcare and education. In this case, it doesn&#8217;t matter if it is financially efficient or not. It must be done.</p>\n<h3>Give money to people who have high spend/save ratios who also buy from other high spending entities</h3>\n<p>So we know that money NEEDS to stay in the hands of those who have a high spend/save ratio. Once it hits a low spending ratio, it will be saved up and others will lose income. So it is important to identify demographics that tend to spend a lot of what they have:</p>\n<p>-Low income families spend most of the money they make because they have to. They are buying essentials for survival and it is very hard for them to save money. On the other hand, the middle class wants to save up due to uncertain times, and they can afford to save money.</p>\n<p>-The elderly usually spend more money because their necessities increase, and the value of saving for the future for them decreases. Yes, they are worried and would save too, but I believe it would still be lower than those who are in their 30s.</p>\n<p>-White males probably have a tendency to spend more than asian females because of cultural values and because woman on average look for security and are more careful with their money. (Note: someone pointed out that women are shopping machines, but I think that men buy more expensive toys. Women could buy $2500 handbags, but more men than women eye at $120,000 cars just to look successful).</p>\n<p>One very important thing to note is that, even if you give money to a person with a high spend ratio, if he spends it on a large corporation, then it becomes less ideal. Yes, corporations spend lots and lots of what they have to operate business. However, they usually pay their employees who are white collar workers (middle class who saves), and the rest go to wealthier shareholders who will hold on to their money very tightly.</p>\n<p>However, if this high spend ratio person spends money at small mom &amp; pops businesses, the small businesses would probably still need to spend more money for essentials instead of thinking of their juicy profits. They probably also pay a lot more low income people again who have a high spend ratio. In this sense, putting money into nonprofits and social workers accomplish both goals of flowing through low-income spenders and fulfilling essentials that keeps society functional.</p>\n<h3>Invest in high potential companies like a Venture Capitalist instead of a Distressed Buyout Firm</h3>\n<p>Right now the government is bashing a lot of dollars into companies that are struggling. However, given the economy, even healthy companies are losing money and making even grimmer future projections. The chances of these dying companies turning into sustainable profitability is extremely slim. Instead of mending a broken rice bag, the government should focus on knitting a new one to catch the leaked rice.</p>\n<p>To save the economy, the government must operate like a Venture Capitalist. It needs to invest in high-growth potential industries. Each dollar needs to go into something that can potentially make thousands of dollars in return (the venture capitalist model: most investments will fail but the ones that succeed will make 100x the investment). These industries can create a lot more jobs that would allow a comeback in the economy.</p>\n<p>Like VCs, instead of simply investing in technologies, the government should help them become commercialized and accelerate market adaption as most paradigm shifting technologies take years to become a business. The US should do what caused countries like Taiwan and Japan to achieve their economic miracles via technology a few decades ago.</p>\n<p>I therefore suggest that the government subsidizes lots and lots of high-tech startups. They should subsidize just enough for the employees to sustain their lives. That way, startup people will be too poor to save money, and they&#8217;re EXTREMELY efficient in driving innovation with very little money. Trust me, A LOT of startup people will continue to do what they love if they didn&#8217;t need to worry about basic living (I live frugally on around $1000 a month so my business can be successful). The problem with the US economy is not that we don&#8217;t produce. Its that too many people get paid too much without TRULY creating value that is worth that much.</p>\n<h3>Internet Infrastructure should be among essentials</h3>\n<p>I don&#8217;t need to spend time arguing why the government should help out with essentials. We need sewage systems, healthcare, education and such no matter what. However, I do want to argue that fast internet should be an essential too.</p>\n<p>The internet is something extremely cheap (when&#8217;s the last time you complained about internet price?), but has the potential to impact millions of lives, rich or poor. Internet infrastructure will simply make everything so much more efficient and faster that the chances of producing $1000 with $1 becomes much more likely. Essentially, any poor boy with the internet could be educated, reputable, and could be potentially running a million dollar business to feed his family.</p>\n<h3>What the Government is doing today</h3>\n<p>With this framework in mind, I was pretty happy to see that it is actually\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2009-02-12-stimulus-package-effects_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">what the government is doing today</a>. The government is obviously pouring tons of money into the essentials like healthcare, social enterprises, and internet infrastructure (awesome). The government is also investing in high growth markets like clean energy and sustainable technologies, so that&#8217;s good too.</p>\n<p>What I would urge the government to do differently is to stop funding those companies who made the mistakes with our taxpayers money. At least make sure every $1 you give them, they are able to produce $10 back, not to give bonuses but to save the country. In 2007, the top 5 financial firms on Wall Street alone paid out $39 Billion worth of bonuses, even though that year the firms&#8217; shareholders collectively lost about $74 billion in stock declines (worst since 2002). Guess how much of that money actually became someone else&#8217;s income? And how much of that went to sleep safely in a Swiss bank?</p>\n<p>Finally, the government should really focus more on small businesses and start-up entrepreneurs, since it helps with both money circulation and driving new innovation. If the government does all of that, I think there will be hope we can believe in after all.</p>\n<p>For a follow-up on this model, read this article: <a href=\" https://jsutshair.online/society/government-pay-entrepreneurs-salaries-save-economy/\">The government should pay entrepreneurs salaries to save the economy</a></p>\n",

I&#8217;ll do my best to keep it short and digest-friendly though. I do feel this topic is VERY important since the economy is going to be entirely restructured in the next two years, and how it is done is extremely important.<br />\nTo start, the US government is said to be <a href=\"http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&#038;pageId=88851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">$65.5 Trillion in debt</a>. For perspective, this is more than the world GDP for one entire year and four times the US GDP for one year. In other words, the US Government literally owes the world to other nations.</p>\n<p>Right now the federal government is behaving like its US citizens who borrow from tomorrow to solve today&#8217;s problems. The US borrows money from other countries to help the irresponsible people and companies clean up the mess they made and hope to &#8220;one day&#8221; be able to pay it back. As you know, when the people couldn&#8217;t pay back their debts, they go bankrupt, and the banks die along with them. If the US keeps getting more debt without promise of making MORE money back, it will end up bankrupted too. The other countries will then end up like failed banks and die too.  </p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m not a doomsday person, and I like to stick to positive and actionable steps, but I do want to emphasize that in this environment EVERY dollar must be spent to its maximum efficiency. I guess we could call it Stimulus Optimization.</p>\n<h3> What the government should do </h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to give you what I believe is the best strategy for Stimulus Optimization, and then layout the logic that got me to this point.</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> Money should stay circulated in old lower income males, small businesses (but not large corporations), social enterprises and non-profits.<br />\n<b>2.</b> Money should be put into industry-creating technologies, but not just for technology development but also the commercialization of the technology.

This is a service that is meant to identify who are the real people who are following you, and who are the spammers.</p>\n<p>It works pretty simple:</p>\n<p>1. Someone follows you<br />\n2. TrueTwit sends a DM with your account asking the new follower to go onto their site and fill out a captcha and prove s/he is human<br />\n3. TrueTwit shows you a list of people who are validated to be humans and so you can safely follow them back.</p>\n<h3>TrueTwit&#8217;s big flaw</h3>\n<p>So far so good. <a href=\"http://www.medicineandtechnology.com/2010/01/use-truetwit-to-reduce-twitter-spam.html\" target=\"_blank\">Neat concept</a>, and definitely trying to solve a pain that is in the Twittersphere. Now the problem comes with this rule of TrueTwit:</p>\n<p>If you are a signed-up user of TrueTwit, you automatically pass the test and will not be prompted to prove you are human if you follow another user.</p>\n<p>From a conceptual level, this is smart, because TrueTwit will get a lot more signups since people want to avoid the hassle of doing captchas over and over again.</p>\n<p>However, here&#8217;s the problem:</p>\n<p><!--more-->1. Most real humans only follow a few people a day. They might need to prove they are human once a month from TrueTwit, which is annoying but not worth the hassle of signing up for a brand new service<br />\n2. Come on, no one REALLY needs to follow you that much. If you make following you a big hassle, they just won&#8217;t follow you and complete the Captcha. Some people I talked to even said they were offended by this request<br />\n3. Many spammers like to follow hundreds of people at short intervals. They have a high chance of suddenly seeing dozens of TrueTwit requests, annoying them the hell out.<br />\n4. Spammers will take an extra step to sign up for service you because they want to spam you. They&#8217;ll do anything they can to grab your attention<br />\n5. As a result, all the spammers will take advantage of the exempt rule and sign up for TrueTwit. Now they can follow thousands of people and pass the real human test without trying</p>\n<h3>Most validated uses on TrueTwit will become spammers</h3>\n<p>What this means, is that if you sign up for TrueTwit, your list of \u201cvalidated followers\u201d would consist of a few people who REALLY want to follow you, and a swarm of spammers who signed up for the service just so they can avoid the Captcha test.</p>\n<p>In that sense, you&#8217;ll be following MORE spammers than if you didn&#8217;t use the service, and you would lose all the real people who are mildly curious about you but does not feel the urge to fill out a captcha just for you.</p>\n<p>TrueTwit, I like your intentions, and I want the spammer problem solved, but you aren&#8217;t doing it in a useful manner. I look forward to you coming up with another way to solve the problem and make the Twittersphere a better place.</p>\n<p>Besides TrueTwit, anyone else recommend a Twitter App service that helps you get rid of spammers?</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n",

Leaving the Golden State was tough, and the team wondered if I could still be running the company from here.</p>\n<p>But afterall, our team was virtual even before I left the states. We had members from a variety of places, and even team members from the same city don&#8217;t sit and work together. So as long as the time zone wasn&#8217;t different, it was not as terrible.</p>\n<p>To prove this point, we recently entered a Vator.tv competition for $10,000 sponsored by Elance, called \u201c<a href=\"http://vator.tv/competition/show/elances-new-way-to-work-competition\">A New Way to Work</a>\u201c. We previously got 10th place in <href =\"http://vator.tv/news/show/2009-10-06-juice-pitcher-first-five-contestants\">a competition out of 140 startups and pitched the Viralogy idea in front of a number of different investors. We also won 1st place at a VC Pitch Competition.</p>\n<p>This project was designed to illustrate the advantages of working virtually on a team without an office. Since we have people from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver, Seattle, Texas, New York, and even Turkey, this was fun to make as we each share our experiences.</p>\n<p>An excerpt:<br />\n<em>Breaking the mold of a localized business allows me to plan my hours and my days the way I want. Whether I work at 2 p.m. or 2 a.m. is up to me, and it allows me to manage my productivity effectively. If I need to spend more time with my dog or my fianc\u00e9e during the day so that I can burn the midnight oil at night, I can do that. If I want to spend my day working on my netbook in a coffee shop, I can do that too. It\u2019s a large responsibility that can be incredibly rewarding if managed well.</em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>Working virtually means that our staff is extremely flexible and respectful of each other\u2019s needs in terms of time. For example, we hold a weekly company meeting at 8 p.m. Those meeting times are extremely rare in the normal corporate culture, but we have found it to be a perfect time to collaborate and think creatively. When you can work in a virtual workplace, you have increased flexibility not only with respect to location, but time as well.</em></p>\n<p>If you want to run a virtual office and don&#8217;t know how, check out the blog de Viralogy!</href></p>\n",

I was just reading Peter Schwartz new blogpost called <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-schwartz/microblogging-with-shitte_b_188816.html\" target=\"_blank\">Microblogging with Shitter &#8211; I mean Twitter</a>. I felt that he totally didn&#8217;t get the true value of Twitter, so I decided to make a long comment on his post. When I was posting, it told me I could only comment for 250 words. That&#8217;s why I was forced to make it a blogpost instead.</p>\n<h3>This post is directly in response to Peter Schwartz (like @ Messaging in a non-microblogging way)</h3>\n<p>OK. Let me address your post as best as I can to someone who has only seen the exterior of Twitter and not the true usage and value of it. Your bashing is vulgar, unfair, and mostly illogical, and I would like to point out why.</p>\n<h3>1) Twitter Journalism is possible<strong> </strong></h3>\n<p>I know you feel that Twitter Journalism is ridiculous, but I think it&#8217;s because you are simply talking about using one tweet to describe everything. There are people who Tweet about their new experiences from moment to moment. People write stories through an aggregate of Tweets (and others DO read it). There&#8217;s also been surgeons who Tweet about their surgery operations while doing it. Now I won&#8217;t argue about the moral implications of that, but it at least proves that Twitter has at least some Journalism applications.</p>\n<h3>2) Just because something else can do it too doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not useful</h3>\n<p>I think your logic is not correct when you said Texting and Cellphone Cameras can also report headline news on the spot. First of all, saying &#8220;something else can do this too&#8221; by no means discredits the quality of the service in mind. When cellphone cameras came out, would you also say, &#8220;Normal cameras can do this too, so it&#8217;s a piece of crap&#8221; if you were not randomly biased against cellphone cameras? Probably not. Also, I can tell you that Twitter reports these news much better and faster than the 2 alternatives you mentioned. If you see a shocking event, you might text it to your 10 friends. These 10 friends will respond &#8220;No way! Are you ok?&#8221; And then maybe tell their 2 friends that are sitting next to them. End of story.</p>\n<p><!--more-->On Twitter, since you are micro-&#8220;blogging&#8221; about the event, everyone learns about the event on Twitter a few minutes after it happens. 20 minutes after the Denver Airport incident, after it already became common knowledge on Twitter, someone on Twitter asked, &#8220;Why is the news not covering this!? This is big!&#8221; That&#8217;s just because he got spoiled by Twitter and forgot that reporters actually need to travel there, learn about what is going on, and finally report the story. Now you can try to beat news reporters in broadcasting shocking news to the world by texting and taking pictures on your camera, but I suspect it would be an uphill battle.</p>\n<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget that people USE their cellphone cameras to take pictures of the events and then send it to friends through Twitter. They are not mutually exclusive because Twitter is only the distribution channel. I guess you were referring to EMAILING your friends with the picture and hope that all of them would check their emails in the next 30 seconds and forward it to your other friends. Hmmm, I see your&#8230;.no I don&#8217;t see it.</p>\n<h3>3) Twitter is for pointing people to the right places and giving quick tips, not for elaborated information like this post</h3>\n<p>You stated that Twitter, by definition, is &#8220;incapable of communicating more than fragments of narrative&#8221; and &#8220;can never supply coherence or meaning.&#8221; I think that is also because you don&#8217;t understand the nature of Twitter. Yes, you don&#8217;t want to teach people how to become an entrepreneur through tweets (some do, actually). You write a BLOGPOST about entrepreneurship and you share it with friends through Twitter. You read something interesting, and you share it with your followers on Twitter. Twitter is not meant to tell you everything. Twitter is meant to give you quick tips of what you want, including links, pictures and ideas. You are having your own delusion about Twitter and saying that it actually can&#8217;t do it. That&#8217;s like saying an iPod cannot turn on the television and is therefore useless.</p>\n<h3>4) Twitter is focused on Value than Revenue right now</h3>\n<p>Regarding Twitter&#8217;s business model, which is unsurprisingly what everyone is bashing at, there is no doubt in my mind that Twitter can make money when it wants to. Twitter can easily function by charging premium membership fees, deploy some promotional items, or contract with companies who want to use it for various purposes. Twitter is different from all the other &#8220;fun sites that make no money and die&#8221; because people don&#8217;t go on Twitter for fun. People integrate it into their lives in a very hardcore manner. Just for an example, there are over 1000 Twitter Apps that are built by developers and companies just to make Twitter better. Some like Tweetdeck even received funding. You don&#8217;t see any other website that people are so hardcore about they create a tool just to make it better instead of investing into making another big startup. Politicians and companies also have used it successfully to promote their brands and campaigns, and as long as that value proposition is there, it will not go away. Sure, it still may fail eventually, but definitely not as easy and matter-of-fact as you say it is.</p>\n<h3>5) No one on Twitter expects a single Tweet to tell the whole story</h3>\n<p>You claimed that Twitter is socially destructive because it gives people the illusion that small bursts of information helps people understand the entire picture of a topic. First of all, this kinda of repeats your early points and I have already addressed how Twitter is mostly a pointer to where valuable information is (especially if you know how to use useful tools like Twitter Search to screen through useless noise). Second, I would say that no one EXPECTS Twitter to convey the entire story (hence the links to a blogpost), therefore I don&#8217;t believe an illusion is created. If I tweeted, &#8220;Feeling very tired. Worked on RewardMe till 3 in the morning,&#8221; I don&#8217;t think anyone would expect to know the entire story regarding what is RewardMe, what was I working on, or did I take so long because I was distracted by something else. All they would know is that I am tired because I was working on RewardMe and it is late. If I wanted people to know more, I would make another Tweet. Again, no one would expect that new tweet is the entire story either.</p>\n<h3>6) Bubble Bursts happen in valuation, not in traffic</h3>\n<p>Regarding your comment about Twitter becoming a bubble and is peaked, I just want to say that being a bubble is just entirely dependent on whether something is overrated or not. In your mind it is, but for people who use Twitter as part of their lives, it&#8217;s not&#8230;.yet (depending on what the valuation will go up to). However, just saying something is a bubble that has peaked simply because lots of people are loving it right now is not a fair statement. You can burst because everyone gives you too high of an evaluation, but you do not burst because everyone loves it and is going onto it. Maybe next month will show a decline in traffic just because some hype is gone, but I can guarantee that it will still be more than last month and Twitter will grow steadily.</p>\n<h3>7) Twitter&#8217;s value is not in its intellectual property but in its community and culture</h3>\n<p>While you are being sarcastic about the wisdom and prudence of VCs, I just want to say that you know there has been AMPLE sites that are trying to copy Twitter right? Most of them failed and some are achieving small success. On the other hand, you might want to check how many startups with nice patents that cost over $20,000 that failed eventually. Actually, let me know how many Internet Startups succeeded or failed because of the lack of patents or the possession of a patent that no one could get around with.</p>\n<h3>8 ) Twitter is a platform</h3>\n<p>Setting the record straighter, Twitter is an application as well as a platform. If you go on Twitter.com and use it, you might say it is an application. But when you factor in all the other apps (stands for Application) out there that build on Twitter&#8217;s platform, it&#8217;s&#8230;well, a platform.</p>\n<h3>9) Twitter is not a fad with mundane day-to-day information</h3>\n<p>Regarding people boring themselves to death due to all the &#8220;desiderata of one&#8217;s day&#8221;, I&#8217;m actually quite disappointed with you saying that. You are a blogger, and you know very well that you can blog about your daily boring things like &#8220;I went to work today and ate lunch&#8221; or you can blog about something that is of value to your readers. Twitter is microblogging, and so just like a blog, if you only tweet what you did in the day, only a handful of your best friends would read it. But if you Tweet to create value for your followers, then you will establish a large following. Once again, would you argue that &#8220;blogging is a fad that will die because no one cares what you did that day&#8221; five years ago?</p>\n<h3>10) Not being Number One does not mean it fails</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you that Twitter may or may not not achieve Windows or iPhone status, but I could easily replace tons of successful products into that sentence and have it still make sense. Saying that Gary Vaynerchuck will never be as rich as Bill Gates and therefore will fail makes absolutely no sense.</p>\n<h3>11) Everything is spam if it is where you don&#8217;t want it to be</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also agree that if we get all the Twitter messages in our inbox, we would treat it like spam. Again, I would also argue that if Huffington Post, Tech Crunch and Mashable sends me an email whenever there&#8217;s a new post, I would treat it like spam too. That&#8217;s why I go to my RSS reader to see these new posts and I go to Twitter (or Tweetdeck/Seesmic Desktop) to see my tweet updates.</p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Finishing up, your argument is mostly based on how there are other tools that can do similar functions (why exclude the best?) and that people get confused about the difference between important and trivial things. I think they&#8217;re both based on a very superficial knowledge of how to use Twitter. I was actually hoping to be more convinced through your logic while I was studying your post in order to make a response. Sadly, I became deeply disappointed with the weak arguments and the bashing for bashing sake. Also, I noticed I started off more polite, but after reading your post line by line it is hard not to write in a similar tone. Next time you find something to bash as a topic that could go viral, at least attach better logic to more research.</p>\n<p>With that said, I would be happy if any of my thoughts or info are not accurate and that you kindly correctly them through logical instead of opinionated statements. Thanks for the post and take care.</p>\n<p>@yukaichou.com (macro-blog) or @yukaichou (micro-blog)</p>\n",

If you followed the advice on my last post about starting and becoming a master on Twitter and have downloaded<a href=\"http://tweetdeck.com\"> TweetDeck </a>, you would easily know that RT is short for <strong>Retweet.</strong></p>\n<p>A Retweet simply indicates that a person values a tweet so much that she tweets it word for word to her followers so that they can benefit from it too. Being Retweeted is a high honor because it means that people are willing to put their own reputation on the line and risk losing followers just to get your message across to more people.</p>\n<p>Even <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/29/its-not-how-many-followers-you-have-that-counts-its-how-many-times-you-get-retweeted/\" target=\"_blank\">Tech Crunch</a> and some <a href=\"http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/11/23/retweet-the-infectious-power-of-the-word-of-mouth/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Experts</a> consider Retweets the best indicators of a person&#8217;s authority and influence on Twitter (as opposed to follower count). There are also numerous sites that just track Retweeted topics or <a href=\"http://www.retweetrank.com/yukai_chou/\" target=\"_blank\">how many Retweets a person has.</a></p>\n<p>Clearly, Retweets has its place of significance on Twitter, and you should RT often. Why?</p>\n<h3>1. Creating Value for your Twitter Followers</h3>\n<p>Twitter is micro-blogging. Just like blogging, people will only read your tweets if it creates value for them. You need to tweet things that are brilliant, hilarious, amazing, ingenious, unique or at least interesting to your followers to make them feel that you are worth the follow. However, you can&#8217;t always come up with the best things yourself. Retweeting is a great way to be that provider of great information without doing the work yourself.</p>\n<h3>2. Get noticed by the people you are Retweeting</h3>\n<p><!--more--><br />\nHow often do you follow someone on Twitter without her following you back? You may have sent @ messages to that person, but you know she gets 400 everyday so she doesn&#8217;t respond to you anyway. But you still want to get noticed. A good way for people to notice you is to Retweet what they have to say. Most influencers on Twitter do a keyword search on their own name, so if you Retweet them, they WILL see it. After Retweeting them a few times, they may become more familiar with you, follow you if you are interesting, or even Retweet your stuff as a gesture of gratitude!</p>\n<h3>3. Teach your followers how to Retweet</h3>\n<p>No matter how brilliant your tweets are, none of your followers will retweet what you have to say if they don&#8217;t know what retweeting is or don&#8217;t know how to do it. That&#8217;s why you have to educate them. By regularly retweeting good content, your followers will begin to understand what this RT business is all about, and they may begin to Retweet your stuff too. If every single one of your followers know how to retweet, you&#8217;ll start seeing your name pile up on the <a href=\"http://www.retweetrank.com/yukai_chou/\" target=\"_blank\">Retweet Ranks!</a></p>\n",

Are you playing a game where you try to make an impact in this world by utilizing your skills and resources around you to solve world problems? Are you playing a game on <a title=\"How to become Influential within your Circle\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/lifestyle-gamification/influential-circle/\" target=\"_blank\">reaching the top of your organization</a> in the shortest amount of time, trying to accumulate as much money(points) as possible, or picking up as many girls as you can?</p>\n<p>You have to think very carefully about what you care about and what accomplishments would make your life meaningful. Choose a game that you feel is worth it and when at the end of the day (or your life), you would feel good because you had accomplished meaningful things and had beaten the game with a high score.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h3>Step 2: Determine your Role in the Game by understanding your Stats and Style</h3>\n<p>Once you have identified the game you are going to play, you need to figure out what role you will play and what the skill sets or resources you must have are.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take my Game of trying to make as big of an impact in this world as possible as an example. Once I have determined that my end goal is impact, I need to figure out what the best way to get to that goal is.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when you look at your <strong>&#8220;initial stats.&#8221;</strong> What are you innately better at than the people you grew up with? Were you always quicker at doing math? Were you the more sociable leader? Were you more creative than your peers?</p>\n<p>I turn out to be better at creating creative connections in my head, establishing deep and meaningful relationships quickly, and discovering the potential of people and\u00a0mobilizing\u00a0them. I am also relatively emotionally stable and can withstand high stress.</p>\n<p>Finding your initial stats is actually something extremely difficult to do, but you can only do it through a lot of self-exploration and trying out TONS of new challenges.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no meter to tell you your stats, and you have to kill enough monsters or get hit enough times to figure out the actual numbers. Being a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\">NPC</a> in town doesn&#8217;t help.</p>\n<p>After you have determined your Initial Stats, you then need to think of the occupation you want to be in.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t just pick something your stats point to, find something that you love doing as a lifestyle.</p>\n<p>In games, I personally hate being a sorcerer where most of the time I&#8217;m hiding, hitting, and running, even though I could potentially become very strong with it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the easy road is not the most fulfilling. <strong>When you think about your occupation, deciding how you can use your initial stats to beat your game (the ultimate goal) in a way you enjoy doing is key.</strong></p>\n<p>OK, this step takes ages, and most people never do it before their midlife crisis. But that&#8217;s why so many young people don&#8217;t know what they do, and so many older people hate their jobs &#8211; they don&#8217;t invest time into this.</p>\n<p><strong>The first &#8220;build&#8221; of a character usually turns out crappy unless there&#8217;s guidance.</strong></p>\n<p>Back to my own example, I feel that since I am good at leading and dealing with people, have a strong balance between random creativity and systematic analysis, and can withstand a lot of stress and uncertainty, my occupation should be an Entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>I can create new systems to improve the world in a creative and interpersonal manner, while withstanding the stress of things-gone-wrong which businesses face all the time.</p>\n<p>My systems creation talent and my passion to help others grow also suggest a side specialization of a Consultant or Coach.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Plan out a Character Skills Growth Road Map</h3>\n<p>Once you have decided on the Game you are playing and your Occupation, it&#8217;s time to plan out a &#8220;build.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you have done the last few steps correctly, this shouldn&#8217;t be too hard.

Click here to see my latest post on how Diablo III uses Gamification to become so addicting</a></h3>\n<h3>TweetDeck vs Seesmic Desktop</h3>\n<p>Up to this point, I have always been a fan of Tweetdeck. I have told quite a plethora of people to download Tweetdeck as soon as they made their first tweet (yes, I do a search on that) . Downloading Tweetdeck is also one of the major steps in my post about <a title=\"Starting Twitter\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/social-media/start-settle-fall-love-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">how to start and fall in love with Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>As far as I know, TweetDeck is the only Twitter App that <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/16/twitter-me-this-tweetdeck-secures-angel-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">raised sizeable funding</a> during the &#8220;old days&#8221; (like 90 days ago) when people still wondered if Twitter would die any day. Good job Tweetdeck!<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h3>TweetDeck is not perfect</h3>\n<p>However, recently I have become a bit more frustrated with Tweetdeck. After they did the Facebook integration (which is great), it was noticeably eating more memory than before. What got me REALLY annoyed is the Group Function of TweetDeck. Yes, the Group function is actually one of the most useful functions around, but creating a new group and adding new friends to it is a PAIN.</p>\n<p>Right when I was being frustrated with this unintuitive way of adding friends to groups, I saw @zaibatsu mention the same frustration about the Tweetdeck group function:</p>\n<div class=\"msg\"><a onclick=\"pageTracker._trackPageview('/exit/to/zaibatsu');\" href=\"http://twitter.com/zaibatsu\" target=\"_blank\"> zaibatsu</a>: <span id=\"msgtxt1522342500\" class=\"msgtxt en\"><a onclick=\"pageTracker._trackPageview('/exit/to/ReallyShecky')\" href=\"http://twitter.com/ReallyShecky\" target=\"_blank\">@ReallyShecky</a> You should see what happens when I try and create a group&#8230; OMFG</span></div>\n<div class=\"msg\"><span class=\"msgtxt en\"><br />\n</span></div>\n<div class=\"msg\"><span class=\"msgtxt en\">However, Tweetdeck&#8217;s biggest flaw to me actually lies in the inability to handle multiple accounts. As a professional who runs various Twitter campaigns for companies, I often find TweetDeck not very helpful outside of running my own personal account. Most entrepreneurs have a personal and a company account anyway, and a tool to manage all accounts would be very helpful. In case you are curious,\u00a0 I usually use a combination of <a href=\"http://hootsuite.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hootsuite</a> and <a href=\"http://tweetlater.com\" target=\"_blank\">TweetLater</a> to manage client accounts. Here&#8217;s also a list of some cool Twitter Apps that I compiled.<br />\n</span></div>\n<h3>Seesmic Desktop Steps In</h3>\n<p>In recent weeks, I learned that Seesmic (owns Seesmic.com and Twirl) is about to launch a new Twitter Desktop Client called Seesmic Desktop. I&#8217;ve always had a decent amount of respect for Loic Le Meur, and I trust in his abilities to launch something that a person like me would want to use. They&#8217;re in &#8220;Preview Mode&#8221; right now and users simply need to signup to Team Seesmic to get a free preview download.</p>\n<p>One thing that you will notice is the similarities between Tweetdeck and Seesmic Desktop. Yes, there are only so many ways you can display columns of information, but even the buttons on the user icons are almost identical. Seesmic obviously modeled it after Tweetdeck and took the useful features while solving some of the flaws, so it does have an unfair advantage. Being in Preview Mode, Seesmic is still buggy and lacks some core functions but I imagine it would be solved soon.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an analysis and comparison of Tweetdeck and Seesmic Desktop.</p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck vs Seesmic Desktop: Memory Usage</h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/04/08/seesmic-desktop-packs-tweetdecks-features-with-a-smaller-footpr/\" target=\"_blank\">people who spent more time than me on this,</a> <strong>Seesmic Desktop only uses a fractions of the RAM compared to Tweetdeck.</strong> It seems like with normal usage, Seesmic Desktop can be run with under 100MB of RAM, where Tweetdeck could go up to 600MB. However, there&#8217;s been some people who have complained that when you are running multiple searches with a lot of columns, Seesmic Desktop becomes as slow as Tweetdeck.</p>\n<p>From my own experience, <strong>everything on Seesmic Desktop is much faster</strong>. They send out Tweets faster, and they pull in data faster. It has not caused a burden to my laptop at all. I think at least before they pack on more features (like connecting to Facebook), Seesmic Desktop is definitely the powerful client that uses less resources.</p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck vs Seesmic Desktop: Viewing Updates</h3>\n<p>While both Tweetdeck and Seesmic Desktop uses pretty similar column views, I think Seesmic has an edge on this one too. Seesmis Desktop&#8217;s interface is much smoother and cleaner. It is also a lot more easier to adjust the columns and move them around. <strong>As you may know, moving the columns from the most left to the most right is quite a hassle on Tweetdeck. Seesmic Desktop lets you simply drag and drop it Apple style.</strong></p>\n<p>The most amazing thing about Seesmic Desktop on this end is it&#8217;s ability to combine ALL your accounts updates into one stream, while deleting the duplicates. You can choose to see all the replies, DMs, timelines, or just single out a single account.</p>\n<p>The default of Seesmic Desktop seems ot be slower than Tweetdeck in terms of retrieving messages.<strong> A flaw of Seesmic Desktop is that this current version does not show an account&#8217;s API limits. </strong>I never know if I&#8217;m about to be locked from the Client world and forced to humble myself and go back to Twitter.com. That should be an easy add though.</p>\n<p>I also want to talk about <strong>Notifications</strong>. Little things like these matter. Tweetdeck&#8217;s notifications are PRETTY annoying. I can get used to the sounds and all. What I cannot get used to is how it blocks the right top of my screen when I want to click on a tab, Spotlight, or whatever right top rights I have during normal usage. There is no way to get rid of it besides waiting for 3 seconds before returning to my normal workflow. Yes, to people who work over 90 hours a week like me, it can be quite irritating when moments of productivity is wasted due to slow internet or blocking alerts.<strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Seesmic Desktop solves this problem by having a very small and unintrusive alert at the BOTTOM right of the screen</strong>. Even better, I can adjust how long I want the notifications to stay around before disappearing. Clearly this was built with people like me in mind.</p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck vs Seesmic Desktop: Handling Multiple Accounts</h3>\n<p>As I said earlier, this is one of the most important features for people who not only play on Twitter but also work on Twitter. I believe the success of Tweetie over Twitterfon is largely based on it having the multiple accounts handling function (btw, the former is the best paid iPhone client, while the latter is the best iPhone FREE client).</p>\n<p>Not only does Seesmic handle as many accounts as you want, accessing each account is just a click of a button on the left. I mentioned earlier that they have a cool feature that combines the entire timeline for all accounts while taking out the duplicates. Even better, <strong>when you reply or DM someone, Seesmic Desktop will automatically tweet that individual with the appropriate account that is associated with the receiver.</strong></p>\n<p>Tweetdeck plain out doesn&#8217;t have this feature, so in this category it is definitely losing.</p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck vs Seesmic Desktop: Grouping and Userlists</h3>\n<p>Grouping (or Userlists) is one of the most useful functions that allows you to follow more people without being overcrowded with information. One of the heated debates of Viralogy.com&#8217;s Awesome Revolution show is the topic Twitter Hoarders vs Twitter Snobs, where people discuss if it is &#8220;wrong&#8221; to not follow everyone who follows you. The &#8220;snob&#8221; side said they would rather have a list of people they really care and can feel proud of, while the &#8220;hoarders&#8221; said you could just use the grouping function. Yes, the grouping function is considered by some to be an essential tool that makes it practical to not be a snob.</p>\n<p>To be honest, Tweetdeck and Seesmic Desktop both have their advantages and disadvantages in the grouping/userlist feature, and none of them do it ideally. In terms of actually creating Groups/Lists, Seesmic is a lot easier and faster. However, <strong>Tweetdeck allows users to see a scroll down list and click through whoever should be in this group when you create the group.</strong></p>\n<p>Personally, I think this is a terrible way of doing things. The only reason why people want to use the Groups functions is because they are following too many people. So how does it help if they have to scroll up and down for half an hour just to locate the 100 people they truly want to follow? Even worse, this is when Tweetdeck freezes up the most. I usually want to create Groups of 30 people on Tweetdeck but often give up after 4. The rest I have to slowly pick out as I see their tweets in my already overflowing timeline. It&#8217;s not fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Seesmic Desktop, however, DOES NOT allow users to add people to their Userlists at the beginning at all. </strong>For that, you can ONLY add people onto the Userlist by identifying them on the timeline. True, their faster search function allows you to find people a lot faster than Tweetdeck (and I highly recommend you to do that), but not providing a list for you to add people at the beginning is very unintuitive to me.</p>\n<p>The solution is really simple. When you create a group, you have a textbox to add people you want in your group. The textbox must have an autocomplete function so you don&#8217;t need to be concerned if your friend is cuteaznbiscuit13 or cuteasianbizcut14. That way you can easily add 100 people onto your new List/Group within a few minutes. Problem solved. I don&#8217;t know why this has not happened yet.</p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck vs Seesmic Desktop: Tweeting</h3>\n<p>I think that Tweetdeck and Seesmic Desktop both have their strengths and weaknesses in terms of Tweeting too. Seesmic Desktop provides a smoother tweeting flow, but Tweetdeck gives you a good punchy feel, as if your Tweet made a bigger difference in the Twittersphere (which is, of course, false).<strong> Tweetdeck has a few more small features like helping you shorten your tweets, and also allows you to go over 140 characters by replacing the end with a link that has your entire over-twoosh in a Twitpic manner.</strong> Yes, you can still send out your tweet when it is showing the red negative sign. Surprise!</p>\n<p>Besides recognizing which account it should tweet with, <strong>Seesmic&#8217;s key Tweeting differentiation is that it adds an instant-photo function to your tweets</strong>. So as long as you have a webcam, you can allow your followers to not only know what you are doing every second, but what you look like every second. One of the most extraordinarily useful features I have seen.</p>\n<p><strong>A good props I want to add to Seesmic Desktop is that they allow you to shorten your urls with the new <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2009/04/02/diggbar-shorten-urls-and-experience-digg-on-any-web-page/\" target=\"_blank\">DiggBar</a></strong>, which may or may not become something big depending on how spammy people think it is (like the ow.ly urls). Finally, Seesmic allows people to drag and drop images into twitpic instead of browsing through your folders. Again, Apple style.</p>\n<p><strong>The main power Tweetdeck has right now over Seesmic Desktop is the Facebook Integration functions.</strong> Now I can actually see what all my &amp;quot;real life&amp;quot; friends are doing. Also, I can tweet more actively into my Facebook status. After this feature was introduced, I noticed a lot my friends started to talk to me more on Facebook, which is definitely a sexy plus. After all, <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/social-media/facebook-not-replace-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook is about keeping in touch with your existing friends, while Twitter is about reaching out to new people, new fields, and new knowledge.</a></p>\n<p>Rumor has it that Seesmic Desktop will integrate the Facebook features too. Lets just hope it doesn&#8217;t kill RAM usage.</p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck vs Seesmic Desktop: Search</h3>\n<p>Again, both clients have their own playing fields in my mind on this one. <strong>Seesmic Desktop makes it easier to do searches. It also makes it easy to switch back and forth between search results</strong>. However, I feel that it is actually harder to view the search results through Seesmic Desktop. Perhaps it has something to do with the silver gradient (compared to the boxed in solid feel of Tweetdeck), but I believe it is mostly due to small spaces for each column.</p>\n<p><strong>Since Seesmic Desktop utilizes the left side for calling out things, the 4 columns need to become smaller compared to Tweetdeck</strong>. Because the columns are narrower, each Tweet takes up more lines, resulting in fewer tweet displayers on the screen. If only I can call up the Search Results through Seesmic Desktop and view it on Tweetdeck!</p>\n<p><strong>Seesmic Desktop also does not allow the user to Follow people through its interface</strong>. It&#8217;s somewhat funny because you can add people you don&#8217;t know to your userlists, but not really your follow list. I&#8217;m sure that is just a few quick fixes away.</p>\n<p><strong>One really big flaw for BOTH clients on search is the lack of ability to modify search results</strong>. I usually like to do searches such as &#8220;RT, Brilliant OR Ingenious OR Amazing OR Hilarious&#8221; to find things that are extraordinary and worth <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/social-media/retweet-friends-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">Retweeting</a> about. Sometimes I would like to modify these terms. Both clients force me to delete the current one and and create a new search. In that case, I still prefer Seesmic Desktop because it allows me to put the new Search where I want to, whereas for Tweetdeck, it&#8217;s the slow column maneuvering again&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Other Twitter Desktop Clients?</h3>\n<p>What are your experiences relating to Seesmic Desktop and Tweetdeck? Or do you think the Killer App actually lies somewhere else? I know there are people who love using DestroyTwitter and Nanbu. I would love to hear from all of you what are the best Clients and how can each improve.</p>\n<p>Also, for a comparison of how Loic Le Meur compares to Jason Calacanis of <a href=\"http://mahalo.com\">Mahalo</a>, check out this article \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<div class=\"msg\"><span class=\"msgtxt en\"><br />\n</span></div>\n",

He was stuck in London, mugged at gun-point, and needs some help to get back to the States. Since English is not my first language, I wasn&#8217;t sure if &#8220;mugged at gun-point&#8221; means someone literally points his gun at you, or just an idiom referring to a certain situation. After trying to look up this term (rude to ask when your friend is really mugged), I saw the official Facebook page explaining this fraud (Thank your super high PageRank Facebook). So I just want to warn my friends about it. </p>\n<p>After knowing it&#8217;s fake, I wanted to get more details of what they are doing. </p>\n<p>I wanted to paste the conversation but realized Facebook don&#8217;t save chat history. Sadness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=2506406\">Here&#8217;s the link to the facebook article</a> </p>\n<p>Basically, it has these elements:</p>\n<p>1) Friend got mugged in London<br />\n2) Needs money to get back to the states<br />\n3) Pretty perfect and sociable English.

They&#8217;re pretty rich dude.&#8221; &#8220;Is there a phone I can call you with?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll just pick you up from the airport and you can stay at me.

This is something that can blow the world away. Honestly, you have no clue if this genius idea would work or not, but it&#8217;s really awesome, and it would be SO amazing if it worked.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are some ideas or solutions that you know is pretty compelling, but not as &#8220;sexy&#8221;. I would say, if this is your first project/startup, focus on the compelling one.</p>\n<h3>A lesson from the birth of Viralogy.com</h3>\n<p>So when we were conceptualizing Viralogy.com in December 2008, we were stuck between 2 ideas: one that was &#8220;genius&#8221;, innovative, and fun, but somewhat shaky. The other one was more &#8220;compelling&#8221; but not as mind-blowing. I mean, a Social Media Rank is cool and meets a big demand in the social mediasphere, but it&#8217;s not like the newest patented technology that will lead an undiscovered industry for the next two decades. It&#8217;s simply something that is needed, and no one else is doing it.</p>\n<p>We all wanted to do the genius and exciting project, but it was also pretty shaky. There were too many possible scenarios that it didn&#8217;t work out. It was a brilliant way to coorindate many moving parts together to create value for all sides and make money. However, with so many moving parts, the stars have to align for all of that to continuously work out without any trouble.</p>\n<h3>If this is your first project, choose the compelling project, and put your genius into that</h3>\n<p>Finally, we decided that the genius project was too shaky, and don&#8217;t want to work for 3 years and have everything fall apart. We then picked the more compelling one. However, at that point, we didn&#8217;t know if this compelling one could make money. We then put in some of our creative juices and then came up with something cool that could make money (That actually wasn&#8217;t compelling and we switched away a bit afterward). We also put in a lot of work to make sure that this &#8220;compelling&#8221; idea is fun, exciting, and even sometimes sexy. And that is the birth of Viralogy.com.</p>\n<p>To prove a point, within our first month of official launch, we garnered around 20,000 unique visitors, 30% of them from Direct Traffic. Three months into the project, we&#8217;ve developed a strong brand name, achieved a Pagerank of 5 (for Viralogy.com/blog), obtained over 100,000 blogs with 1.2M blog calls, and <a href=\"http://siteanalytics.compete.com/viralogy.com/\">solid traffic</a>. We got to this point because unlike many other &#8220;innovative&#8221; startups, we were compelling, and we used our creativity to push it through.</p>\n<p>Trust me, even if you think something is compelling, there&#8217;s still going to be so many variables that get in your way that require your brilliance to solve. For the same reasons, Good to Great tells you to do what you are the best at in the world, not what&#8217;s the coolest or most popular.</p>\n<p>If this is your first project, pick the compelling solution, use your genius within that, and build a foundation/reputation that can support your other brilliant ideas.</p>\n",

Everyone says print is dead, and there are fewer and fewer people reading physical newspapers, and fewer and fewer companies want to advertise on them. They are trying to build up their online division, but there are so many free sites out there and so much competition that it&#8217;s very difficult to become established too. He asked me for some advice.</p>\n<h3>Take all your established resources in the dying industry and focus on the new booming industry</h3>\n<p>I told him that, being a worldwide brand that they are, they should really take that brand, and focus more energy on the online division. Yes, they have more competition, but they are more established, especially to their target market that is slowly moving online.</p>\n<p>If they think of themselves as startup in the online arena, they will realize it&#8217;s not grim at all. They actually have so much established, so many assets, and a strong brand name. And with that, with the same amount of effort, they will beat their competitors. The problem is that their competitors who are entirely web based, focus 100% of their energy on their online department, whereas this company only spends about 20% of their resources on it. Of course they will lose.</p>\n<p>Take what you have, pull it out of the dying industry, and put in all your efforts in the new booming industry. If you can&#8217;t adapt as fast as the environment moves, you will become a victim of natural selection.</p>\n",

The only way this can work, is if you are 100% representative of your customers, which is rarely the case. Don&#8217;t be arrogant and think you know more about the customers than themselves.

How do you prevent such from happening to you? Here are a few principles.</p>\n<h3>If someone behaves shadily to someone else, they will eventually do that to you too</h3>\n<p>The key to knowing who to trust is not how close they are to you, but what their core values are. When there are no zero-sum game going on between you, it&#8217;s easy to be friends. However, for some people, once they can get some advantage by screwing you over, that becomes an obvious choice.</p>\n<p>If you have a friend who often talks about how he tricked someone else, even though he told you because you are buddies, you have to be careful of his later on. On the other hand, if your friend is always talking about how to help others, then even if you are not as close of a friend, you can trust them more.</p>\n<p>This is like judging if you want to date/work with someone based on how they treat waiters and waitresses. If they treat you will, it just means they want something from you, but you can evaluate they true personality by how they treat others.</p>\n<h3><strong>Careful of those who just talk about making money</strong></h3>\n<p>If you are working with someone who just talks about money all the time, you should be careful. In their minds, making money is one of their high priorities in life, and even though working with them as partners might get you to gain a lot, it also means that there are chances that they will screw you over for a big enough paycheck. If a person always talks about &#8220;creating an impact&#8221; or &#8220;changing the industry&#8221; then you have a better feel of what motivates them and you can trust them a little better.</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with wanting money or working with people that just want money. However, it&#8217;s a good red flag to raise before you completely get screwed over by someone who has been treating you well for three years.</p>\n<h3>Build your reputation with trust</h3>\n<p>In the same way, you want to build up your reputation with the right values too. If you are always talking about making money and showing off how you ripped off some stupid person, not only do you sound sleezier, but overdoing that will cause people to trust you less. Idealy you don&#8217;t want to ever be shady and do thing with integrity, but either way, you don&#8217;t want to promote that part of your personality to people.</p>\n<p>Rather sound altruistic and naive than too materilistic and calculatey. A lot of people would want to work with you if they think you are easily tricked, instead of thinking that you are out there to trick people.</p>\n",

All of them deserve to be put on a pedestal because they&#8217;ve sold successful startups, written best-sellers, and have built personal brands that are the envy of every Gen-Y.  Though their content is amazing, we can&#8217;t help but feel a huge disconnect.  Sure, they understand Gen-Y and are very in touch with us, but they aren&#8217;t us.</p>\n<p>We want to learn from our peers. We want to learn from those who are in the trenches like us and that are accessible at anytime.  Realizing this pain, we went out and assembled the Viralogy Experts team:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://manvsdebt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Baker &#8211; Personal Finance</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thrillingheroics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cody McKibben &#8211; Location Independence</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://prevential.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Halpern &#8211; Psychology in Social Media</a></li>\n<li>Steve Spalding &#8211; Business and Strategy </li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thelostjacket.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stuart Foster &#8211; Marketing and PR</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each one of these bloggers have proven to show an expertise in their field.  They are amazing bloggers who are doing great things online, and we&#8217;re very proud to have them on the team.  Each week, a new post will be written and published by one of our authors.  Here are the expected post dates:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Today &#8211; Stuart Foster (Marketing and PR)</li>\n<li>June 22nd &#8211; Cody McKibben (Location Independence)</li>\n<li>Month of July &#8211; to be announced</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Why are all of the Experts guys?</strong> Good question!  It really just turned out this way. We reached out to a few target people and only gentlemen accepted the position.  We know that there are so many amazing women bloggers out there who are experts on a topic, and if you&#8217;re one of them, please reach out to me so that we can talk about bringing you on board.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I become an Expert?</strong> Another good question!

We want you to focus on your content, and at the same time, have a theme that completely fits your style and topic.  That&#8217;s why <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://twitter.com/norcross\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Norcross</a> and the Viralogy Crew have teamed up  to create Viralogy Themes, the best, most customizable themes in the universe!</p>\n<p>We currently feature 3 fully-customizable premium wordpress themes.  Each one is widget ready, optimized for search engines, and includes essential features like most-viewed posts, most-commented posts, threaded comments, and a Twitter sync.</p>\n<p>You can preview the themes here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>JunPress</li>\n<li>ChouPress</li>\n<li>PhenPress</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>If you are a blogger whose blog is hosted on .wordpress.com or .blogspot.com, then we have a special package just for you.  We&#8217;ll set you up with a self-hosted wordpress blog, create a custom design of a Viralogy Theme of your choice, and teach you how to drive traffic to your blog.  If interested, shoot Jun an email at Jun.Loayza [at] Viralogy.com and we&#8217;ll set you up with our special package.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We are open to creating more themes, so if you have a theme structure in mind that you would like us to create, email Andrew Norcross (restlesslikeme [at] gmail.com) and if your theme structure is unique, beautiful, and simple, we might consider making a Viralogy Theme just for you.</p>\n",

A month later, we think it&#8217;s so crappy that we are embarrassed to send it to anyone. Then we make a super improvement and think it&#8217;s the best thing in the world again. After a month of sending it to everyone, we realize it&#8217;s so hideous that we don&#8217;t want to send it to anyone again. We did that for half a dozen times. </p>\n<p>Sometimes we tell ourselves, &#8220;If it&#8217;s good enough to be sent to everyone during the first revision, it should be good enough when it&#8217;s version 4. We don&#8217;t need to wait 2 weeks for version 5 to come out.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Improve your product with your users/customers</h3>\n<p>If it takes a year to create a good product, taking a year and improving it at home will not be anywhere close to launching it early and using the rest of the time to improve from customer feedback. As long as you are responding to them and improving fast, they will be patient with you. </p>\n<p>Even if you disappointed the first 100 people who used the site, you make sure that the Millions of others use a good product later on. Plus, the first 100 will hear it if you do a good job a year later and come back to it.</p>\n<h3> Take rare criticism seriously</h3>\n<p>Most of the time, you will hear people saying how good your stuff is. However, pay extra attention when someone says you need to improve, especially when it&#8217;s someone with more experience. </p>\n<p>People don&#8217;t like to tell you negative things, so when you happen to hear one, it might be a rare opportunity for you to realize what are the biggest things you need to work on. </p>\n",

Are sales increasing? </p>\n<h3>Social Media is about being Social. It&#8217;s about Networking</h3>\n<p>When you go to an event, you are there to network and build relationships. You aren&#8217;t making any sales, but you know that if people like you and they know what you do, one day they will find you when they need you. They will also tell their friends when someone asks about similar services.</p>\n<p>If you are at an event just trying to close sales, no one will like you. You might get 1-2 more sales, but you piss off everyone and no one wants to associate with you afterwards.</p>\n<p>In Social Media, you are there to build brand and relationships, not to convert immediate sales.</p>\n<p><strong>At the end of the day, Social Media is like brand building and networking: no immediate ROI, but indispensable for business.</strong></p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s the ROI of a Bill Board?</h3>\n<p>Companies can&#8217;t measure how much ROI their Bill Boards are generating, but they still do it anyway. You&#8217;re not supposed to put up a billboard and take it down after 2 weeks if your extra sales has not been able to cover the billboard costs. </p>\n<p>Social Media is about building trust and relationships.

I definitely agree. You would not bet money on a guy who&#8217;s playing a video game for the first time ever. If he has beaten a similar game before, he has much better odds. After all, everyone of us would be better than ourselves right now 10 years later.</p>\n<h3>Unproven Entrepreneurs tend to have more drive and work more crazy hours</h3>\n<p>However, experienced entrepreneurs who have successful exits in the past may also lose their drive compared to the first time they try. After all, they now have a comfortable life and it&#8217;s subconsciously it is fine if they lose. First time entrepreneurs don&#8217;t have that luxury and have a much stronger drive just because they might be living on their savings. They have to succeed. They are also looking to prove themselves while the successful entrepreneur has already proven himself successful.</p>\n<h3>Find good mixes of both</h3>\n<p>I think a good combo would be one founder with successful startups in the past, and another founder who is unproven but has the drive to push everything over his limit. Obviously successful entrepreneurs are difficult to find, so another good combo might be people who have failed 1-2 startups. They have the experience of what works and what doesn&#8217;t work, they spend a couple years developing relationships, and they still have the eagerness and drive to push themselves to the limits. The fact that they could fail a few times and get back to it shows their commitment.</p>\n<p>If you are a successful entrepreneur who has strong exits in the past, make sure you don&#8217;t lose your drive. Always push yourself to the max regardless of how comfortable your backup is like. After all, you are there to make a bigger impact and create a new legacy.</p>\n",

That explains why I haven&#8217;t been able to update my blog as often. That&#8217;s why I am starting to Vlog more now. It is not as good for SEO because there is very little text, but at least I keep you guys engaged \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>Viralogy has been incredibly successful though. We just launched 4 weeks ago, and we already have unique visitors in the mid five-digits, with 30% of that from direct traffic. That means people are recognizing our brand and going back to our site. I&#8217;ve also been meeting people who have heard about us at almost every single event I went to, so that&#8217;s a good sign too.</p>\n<p>I think at this point we are still very far away from success, but we have already built a small plane, went through the runway, and took off. We&#8217;ll need better planes and better pilots to make sure we get to our destination, but we&#8217;re at a good start. Right now our company of 10 has been extraordinary, and my job is to make sure it stays that way \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<h3>Lesson in the Video</h3>\n<p>If you want to market to teens, you can&#8217;t rely on market data and research. You have to be there where the teens are. Play their games, join their chat rooms, hang out with them. That&#8217;s the only way you can understand what they really like.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s like trying to buy a present for a kid. If you just have tons of research about the kid&#8217;s demograhic, chances are you won&#8217;t buy a birthday present for a kid that he loves. BUT if you were his uncle that plays with him often, you have a very good chance to buy that birthday present that he loves.</p>\n<p>Be that uncle, not a marketer.</p>\n",

Sure, there&#8217;s <a href=\"http://alexa.com\" target=\"_blank\">Alexa</a> and a few other sites out there that measure traffic too, but lately I&#8217;ve mostly been hearing people talk about Compete.com traffic instead of the other ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://quantcast.com\" target=\"_blank\">Quantcast</a> offers more accurate data because it is actually based on scripts that is embedded in these sites, but because of that, the sites it covers are also limited.</p>\n<h3>How Compete.com evaluates traffic</h3>\n<p>Compete.com evaluates each site&#8217;s traffic by a sample group of roughly 2 million internet users (what they say is 2% of all internet users) based on ISPs, ASPs, Opt-In Panels and the Compete.com Toolbar.</p>\n<p>Through some complex statistical calculations, they roughly estimate how many people really go on your site from this sample group.</p>\n<p><!--more-->I would say Compete.com gives a fairly good feel of if a website is popular or not, especially if you use it to compare to other sites in the same field (hence the name &#8220;Compete.com&#8221;).</p>\n<p>Since it uses ISPs (Internet Service Providers) as one of their metrics, it is stronger than sites like Alexa that mostly base traffic on those who use their toolbars.</p>\n<p>However, there&#8217;s still a lot of inaccuracy in Compete.com. After years of usage and comparing it to Google Analytics data from many sites that I managed, I have some interesting observations of how Compete.com&#8217;s behavior differ from actual traffic. (Note: Google Analytics does not reflect 100% actual traffic, but it is definitely a whole lot closer than Compete.com, so I will take that number as a standard).</p>\n<h3>Compete.com does not measure traffic outside the US</h3>\n<p>One thing to quickly establish about <strong>Compete.com is that it only measures traffic from the United States.</strong> That&#8217;s because its ISP partners are in the States, and it has a much bigger penetration in terms of US ASP (Application Service Providers) from other websites.</p>\n<p>If you look at a very popular site in Taiwan, <a href=\"http://wretch.cc\" target=\"_blank\">Wretch.cc</a>, you will see that Compete does not report any traffic from them.</p>\n<p>However, almost all my friends from Taiwan has a Wretch account, and it&#8217;s pretty much as popular as Facebook there. I am 99.99% certain that it at least has hundreds of thousands of monthly users.</p>\n<p>Google recognizes the popularity of Wretch and gives it a Page Rank of 7/10, an astonishing high number equal to the blogs of <a href=\"http://guykawasaki.com\" target=\"_blank\">Guy Kawasaki</a> and <a href=\"http://mashable.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mashable</a>.</p>\n<p>From this you can see that it is NEVER a good idea to take Compete data and tell someone that an overseas service is not very popular.</p>\n<h3>Compete.com inflates traffic for sites in the Social Media World</h3>\n<p><strong>If you are looking at a website that is popular in the social media industry, then Compete.com traffic will likely look better than it actually is.</strong></p>\n<p>This is because there are way more people in Social Media that uses the Compete.com Toolbar. If 10% of the people with Compete.com Toolbars visit a certain site, Compete.com will come to think that 10% of internet users go onto this site (before factoring in all the other metrics), and they will help boost your overall score on compete.com.</p>\n<p>Also, I am not sure who are the Application Service Providers of Compete.com, but I&#8217;m guessing that it has something to do with various popular websites, and visitors of those websites would also get extra &#8220;Compete.com Points&#8221; for the sites they visit.</p>\n<p>Take my blog for example. Compete.com rated my traffic last month as roughly 21,000 unique visitors. However, that is much higher than my actual traffic.</p>\n<p>Compete.com mostly thinks that my site traffic is that high because many of my readers have the Compete.com Toolbar, and that a lot of people find me through Social Media sites like Twitter or other blogs. Again, I&#8217;m not 100% sure how these sites relate to Compete.com, but it seems to me that they are weighted more on Compete.com than the actual traffic.</p>\n<h3>Compete.com under-ranks Google Search traffic</h3>\n<p>This one is pretty interesting, and perhaps the biggest insight this post has to offer. I have noticed time and time again that sites that have huge Google search traffic is underrated&#8230;by a lot, on Compete.com.</p>\n<p>Lets take <a href=\"http://seanpercival.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Percival</a>, a respected figure in the online content and SEO world. In one of his <a href=\"http://www.seanpercival.com/blog/2009/03/13/how-many-little-birdies-does-twitter-bring-you/\" target=\"_blank\">blogposts</a>, Google Analytics showed that he had close to 140,000 unique visits on his site that month, of which 105,000 of them are from Google.</p>\n<p>However, Compete.com only shows that his traffic is lower than 30,000 during the same month. <strong>You can see that Sean&#8217;s actual traffic is WAY over what Compete.com thinks he has. Interestingly enough, if you take out all his Google traffic, compete.com would be quite close to the actual number.</strong></p>\n<p>Another example would be <a href=\"http://www.top10seotips.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Wiideman</a>, a credible SEO Expert who is also on FD&#8217;s advisory board. Yes, many people call themselves SEO Experts, but he is truly one. You can tell by Googling &#8220;SEO Expert&#8221; and &#8220;SEM Expert&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Even though his site consistently ranks as the first or second results for SEO Expert and SEM Expert, terms that are searched quite a bit, his compete.com traffic is lower than 3,000. It is pretty convincing that his real traffic is way above 3,000 a month, and we can conclude that Compete.com underestimates his traffic too.</p>\n<h3>How to tell if compete.com is underestimating a site&#8217;s traffic</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve made the mistake of prejudging a website&#8217;s popular by looking at the compete.com traffic. I have even made a fool of myself before because of that. To avoid these mistakes here are a few tips to go by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If a website looks like it could mostly be used by foreign users outside the US, assume that the traffic is way too low.</li>\n<li>If a website has high Page Rank (you can check PR easily with various Firefox Plugins) but low traffic on Compete.com, assume that the traffic is underestimated.</li>\n<li>If you are on a blog or social media site and it has SOME compete.com traffic, assume that it is ovestestimated.</li>\n<li>No matter what you do, don&#8217;t take compete.com data and report it to others as a fact. Always take Quantcast.com traffic over compete.com if they happen to have data on the site.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Ways to boost your compete.com traffic</h3>\n<p>Here are some pretty straight forward tips to help your compete.com Traffic look better. Most of these techniques are standard ways to help you get real traffic too, but having compete.com in mind. Yes, having high traffic on compete.com is not nearly as good as actual traffic, but sometimes you will get more opportunities when people believe that a lot of others like your site.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the compete.com Toolbar, and tell all your friends/users/readers to download the compete.com Toolbar.</li>\n<li>Learn how to generate traffic from various social media sites. This is a professional art that companies are paying to do, but once you know how to establish a brand name in these sites and drive traffic to your own site through it, compete.com seems to value that more.</li>\n<li>Get publicity through blogging and get publicized by other blogs. Again, a good amount of compete.com Toolbar users read blogs, so try to capture a larger portion from that demographics.</li>\n<li>Even though Search Engine traffic does not rank well in Compete, when you are optimizing your search engine strategies, focus on search traffic that will come from the States.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Good luck on getting a lot more actual traffic on your sites! If you are a blogger, the  Viralogy Blog Rank might help!</p>\n",

Most people who first go on Twitter have no idea why anyone would use it, and that Twitter is something for those who have too much time and nothing to do. Not for me.</p>\n<p>Then they would hear about Twitter again from a friend or some media source, and decide to try it out again. They create 2 more tweets, and still feel that life is wasting away. Finally, they hear that a good friend or Obama is using Twitter too, and finally gives it another try. That&#8217;s when they become glued.</p>\n<p>The fact is that Twitter is actually a very useful and fun (we call this very FD) tool. Its not necessarily for people who have too much time, but it actually is for busy people who need a better way of communicating with people.</p>\n<p>Just like the <a href=\"http://www.kirksheltonart.com/art/In_N_Out-menu2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">In&#8217;N&#8217;Out menu</a>, where they keep everything as simple as possible with<a href=\"http://daviswiki.org/In-N-Out_Secret_Menu\" target=\"_blank\"> hidden menu items</a>, Twitter keeps everything as simple as possible. Even Twitter Search is hidden at an non-obvious location. Finally, there are over 400 Twitter Apps out there that make Twitter better that could help with your Twitter experience. You should know a few good ones.</p>\n<p>For this reason, here&#8217;s a guide for the beginner to &#8220;get&#8221; Twitter and become a Tweeter.</p>\n<h3>1. Create a Twitter Account with your real name</h3>\n<p>Registration is simple. If you don&#8217;t know how to create a account once you go to twitter.com, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be on Twitter. However, I want to remind you that almost in all instances, you should put in your real name. Twitter is about building relationships with real people for who they are, instead of meeting Surferdude24s.</p>\n<p>Also, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">keep your Twitter username short and easy to remember</span>. This is so that people can Retweet you easier without hitting the limit, and people can type in your name without other references.</p>\n<p><!--more-->Nowadays also Twitter asks you if you want to follow some celebrities on the site when you register. You can do that just to get a flow of things. Not too important. Also, I recommend you not to import your contacts yet. You should first set up your profile.</p>\n<h3>2. Set up a cool profile</h3>\n<p>Looking cool is very important on Twitter. There&#8217;s a limited amount of information you can put on Twitter for people to figure out who you are, so make sure it represents a personality that people want to associate themselves with.</p>\n<p>Choose an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">interesting picture of your face</span>. I don&#8217;t recommend going with nice scenery pictures because people can&#8217;t remember you with it. Use your real picture. Also, make sure whatever is in the picture is large, or else no one can see it. Putting on your real face sometimes results in people recognizing you when they see you elsewhere online or even in real life.</p>\n<p>However, make your picture more interesting with some effects so you stand out above the crowd. Pick your picture wisely, because it is not good to change it. People on Twitter often recognize you by your icon instead of by your user name.</p>\n<p>Make sure you include a website. Your blog is ideal, because it represents you the most. Your company is fine too, but not as authentic. Finally,\u00a0 if you don&#8217;t have any website, at least link to your facebook public profile, LinkedIn profile, or SOMETHING. Just please have a link for people who want to learn a little bit more about you.</p>\n<h3>3. Create a nice background</h3>\n<p>(note: if you are just trying out Twitter, this step could be skipped for time sake. You can always come back for this)<br />\nIf you look at profiles like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yukai_chou\" target=\"_blank\">mine</a> or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/junloayza\" target=\"_blank\">Jun&#8217;s</a>, you can see that our backgrounds are different to the default one. The idea is to maximize space efficiency on your real estate and let people learn more about you.</p>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"http://www.freetwitterdesigner.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Free Twitter Designer</a> to customize your background. Once you get the image done, go to settings-&gt;backgrounds.</p>\n<h3>4. Create your first Tweet</h3>\n<p>Now that you created your cool profile, you are ready to launch to the world. Go to the homepage and make your first Tweet (update your status). Say something like &#8220;Hello! I am new to Twitter and am ready to meet some interesting people!&#8221; Seem positive, curious and explorative. Most importantly, be authentic.</p>\n<p>At this point, no one will see your tweet. However, this is useful as an introduction when you start to contact others.</p>\n<h3>5. Import email contacts</h3>\n<p>At this point you are ready to import the people you already know. Go to &#8220;Find Friends&#8221; and import all your email contacts. This step should be simple enough. The people you know are most likely to follow you back, and hopefully they are the people you care about the most too.</p>\n<h3>6. Find good Tweeters to follow</h3>\n<p>Now that you got your profile set up and have invited your existing friends, now you are off hunting for more cool people to follow and integrate into your Twitter village.</p>\n<p>There are A few tools I recommend. First go to <a href=\"http://twitter.grader.com/search\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Grader Search</a>. Type in keywords that you are interested in like &#8220;design&#8221; &#8220;architecture&#8221; &#8220;surfing&#8221; or &#8220;entrepreneurship.&#8221; It will list out some of the best tweeters for you to follow. Also, use Mr Tweet to introduce some interesting people to you.</p>\n<h3>7. Download Tweetdeck</h3>\n<p>This is key. Tweetdeck is something that lowers the learning curve of Twitter and makes sense of everything. It is a desktop application that allows you operate Twitter without going onto Twitter.com. (there are many like apps and you can find what you like the most. Most good Twitter users don&#8217;t go onto Twitter.com that often. I have tried quite a bit and have decided that Tweetdeck is the best) This step is a must as it enables the following steps.</p>\n<h3>8. Create search streams for everything you care about on Tweetdeck</h3>\n<p>In Tweetdeck, you not only can see your friends&#8217; tweets, their @ replies, and direct messages, it also allows you to get keyword alert streams. This is how you do it:</p>\n<p>Go onto the left top and click the magnifying glass. It will then ask you for keywords. Now input everything you care about, separated by the words &#8220;OR&#8221;. Make sure you search for your own name and company. For instance, I would search &#8220;Yu-kai OR yukai_chou OR &#8220;Future Delivery&#8221; OR viralogy&#8221;. In this way, I will be notified whenever someone mentions my name or my company.</p>\n<p>You can also search about terms such as &#8220;brilliant OR hilarious OR ingenious&#8221; to find what&#8217;s interesting on Twitter. Add a &#8220;RT&#8221; to make sure everything you see is worth retweeting hence higher quality. I will let your creativity decide on the rest.</p>\n<h3>9. Activate Tweetscoop in Tweetdeck</h3>\n<p>OK. So this is not a must, but it sure is worth trying for beginners. Tweetscoop allows you to identify what are the hottest topics on Twitter. It is displayed using a tag cloud format, where if a certain topic is mentioned over and over again at that time on Twitter, that keyword will enlarge. This will allow you to see trendy topics and often times be aware of breaking news long before a news source covers it.</p>\n<h3>10. Install other Twitter Apps on your mobile app, Facebook, Blog, and Netvibes/iGoogle</h3>\n<p>Once you got your nice Twitter stuff set up, now you need to make sure it is easily accessible. That means you should be able to update your tweets no matter where you are. You should download the right Cellphone App (for the iPhone, Twitterfon is the best free app, and Tweetie is the best one overall). You should integrate it with Facebook and pull the widgets into your Netvibes or iGoogle page. Just make sure Twitter is always accessible.</p>\n<p>For a list of Twitter Apps, you can check my twitter apps rating post or here.</p>\n<h3>11. Create value for your followers. Find interesting topics and RT good stuff</h3>\n<p>Twitter is microblogging. Like blogging, people will only be your audience if you create value for them. This means that you SHOULD NOT tweet mundane things like &#8220;I am buttoning my first button.&#8221; &#8220;I am buttoning my second button.&#8221; or &#8220;I just blinked.&#8221; Truth be told, besides your mother, NO ONE CARES. If you are on Twitter just for your mother that is fine too. This post is not useful for you.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are on Twitter to connect with the world, you need to tweet useful links of articles that you love, fun facts, interesting thoughts you have, weird personal encounters and more. Since you have set up your Tweetscoop and your Keyword Alert, you should be finding a lot of good content. Now you just need to Retweet (RT) them to your followers. Also, ALWAYS respond to your followers. Twitter is not about amassing a great amount of followers if they don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s about building relationships with them so everyone cares about each other.</p>\n<h3>12. Find more friends and watch your followers grow</h3>\n<p>If you are tweeting a lot of value to your followers, people will begin to notice you and follow you. Also, when you follow other people, they will look at your profile and tweetstream to decide if they want to follow back. If you have done steps 1-10, then all you have to do is sit back, enjoy, and watch your followship grow.</p>\n<p>(If you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">truly</span> believe this post is helpful, please send it to your friend who doesn&#8217;t understand twitter or tweet &#8220;How to Start, Settle in, and Fall in love with Twitter http://bit.ly/1XBqg&#8221;)</p>\n",

Its about 16 minutes long but I think every minute is worth the watch (I rather you watch it instead of read this blogpost). </p>\n<p>This film touched me because I felt a lot of empathy towards the guy, as I have always tried to make others in my life happier. When I was in kindergarten, I felt that because people around me (especially my family) were living such sad lives, I had no right to be unhappy.</p>\n<h3>Empathy towards a guy who had no right to be unhappy</h3>\n<p>I had to be happy, because peoples&#8217; happiness depended on me. When everything is falling apart in life, I at least would be that pillar of happiness that holds everything together. Consequently, whenever I cried during my childhood, I felt ashamed and hid from others.</p>\n<p>Today, my friends say that I&#8217;m one of the most optimistic people they know. They tell me that talking to me makes them happy, no matter how down is the situation. They also say that I am extremely emotionally stable, and that&#8217;s because I do not want to ever be an emotional burden to others. </p>\n<p>I need to be the one who is calm and happy when others are down. If I ever become emotionally unstable and need others to help me feel better, I feel that I not only failed in my responsibilities, I have become a burden to others. </p>\n<p>My goal in life is to make others successful, and its like a sharp blade through my heart whenever I know I&#8217;m being a burden to people instead.</p>\n<h3>People who seem happy all the time would still appreciate the right to be upset</h3>\n<p>But the truth is, sometimes I do become upset. </p>\n<p>Sometimes I feel that people take advantage of my constant attempts to put others before me, and I occasionally would express that unhappiness to people. </p>\n<p>The sad thing is, whenever I do express such unhappiness, people are not used to it coming from me, and they become very defensive, asking &#8220;what in the world is your problem?&#8221; When people confirm my sad belief that I have no right to be sad, it depresses me even more.</p>\n<p>Why should the child who cries all day get whatever he wants, while the child who also wants to cry but recognizes that her parents already have enough troubles in life for them to worry about her get nothing? And when she finally can&#8217;t stand it and starts to cry about something, her parents will not understand her unnoticed pains but just become angry at her for raising more problems (she should know better!), while they appeal to the other child who cries all day.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>I hate it when life becomes perfect when I become ANGRY</h3>\n<p>Whenever I feel upset because of the way people treat me (and that is VERY rare), people seem to get mad at me even more. </p>\n<p>It is only until I become ANGRY that people recognize that they have been taking things too far. </p>\n<p>For some reason, whenever I become angry, all my relationship problems are solved. </p>\n<p>There suddenly is peace and harmony in the world, and these people treat me with basic respect again. </p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s just a result of saying mean words. </p>\n<p>But why do I need to become angry for things to work out? Can&#8217;t I just simply point out that, &#8220;this is making me upset&#8221; and people can answer politely with, &#8220;oh, I apologize for making you upset. I&#8217;ll try not to do it next time&#8221; (which I say everytime, even if I didn&#8217;t understand why my actions were wrong. I still made someone upset)? </p>\n<p>For some reason, it never works out like that. They always need to come up with an excuse to say that it&#8217;s actually my fault, and then question why would I need to become so difficult.</p>\n<h3>A weakness for sorry</h3>\n<p>Btw, I am a huge sucker for the word &#8220;sorry&#8221; (note, this is not &#8220;OK, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;). </p>\n<p>In elementary school, I&#8217;ve had older kids bully me for an entire year (including practicing jump kicks on me and spit a whole mouthful of water all over my face), and when they frighteningly apologized after that day I became angry, I was no longer upset about them. </p>\n<p>How easy. </p>\n<p>In high school, there was a girl who for some reason hated me and always took initiative to hurt my feelings whenever she could (including saying things like &#8220;some people [me] don&#8217;t deserve to have a Chinese name,&#8221; purposely opened another door and slammed it when I opened the door for the entire class, and told others not to talk to me), and when I confronted angrily with her after trying to be a gentleman for an entire year, she apologized so many times and said it&#8217;s just because she had a lot of stress in school and unjustifiably dumped it all on me. </p>\n<p>I was happy again afterwards. Yea, that easy. </p>\n<p>Sometimes it makes me angry how easy it is for me to become happy again just because they used a simple word to wipe out an entire year of abuse, but its not really something I can control. I just become happy. </p>\n<p>It amazes me how some people still manage to continuously make me upset when I am so easy to handle in that sense.</p>\n<h3>The main character in the film reminds me of how people often value what you offer but not who you are</h3>\n<p>Anyway, in the film (spoiler alert), this is a person who constantly strives to make others happier. Everyone enjoys what he brings them, but they don&#8217;t really appreciate him as a person. </p>\n<p>After he becomes sad (he has full right to become so), people seem to not only be disappointed, but MAD at him! </p>\n<p>No one even tried to comfort him and ask him why is he upset. They just blamed him for not making their lives better anymore. </p>\n<p>His boss even fired him even though he was still doing his job right. </p>\n<p>Yea, now he owes the world everything because he stopped being happy and is just functioning like everyone else.</p>\n<h3>All he needs is someone to reciprocate what he has always been doing!</h3>\n<p>At the end of the clip, when the girl finally says positive things about him, he said in such wonder, &#8220;No one has ever said that about me before&#8230;&#8221; </p>\n<p>When he said that, it touched my heart and almost made me choke. </p>\n<p>He&#8217;s been trying to make other peoples&#8217; lives better without asking for anything in return, as seeing them being happy is enough for him. But all it takes for someone to make the best day of his life is to simply reciprocate what he has been doing his entire life! </p>\n<h3>Hypercrisy as a new word and a way of living</h3>\n<p>This is like the opposite of being a hypocrite. I looked up the root word of hypocrisy, and saw its a combination of &#8220;hypo&#8221; (under) and &#8220;krinein&#8221; (to sift or decide&#8221;). </p>\n<p>If holding a lower standard for oneself compared to others is hypocrisy, then I will call holding a higher standard for oneself compared to others &#8220;hypercrisy&#8221;.</p>\n<p>So yea, I won&#8217;t say I&#8217;m as noble and extreme as the guy in the clip, but it is true that I put everyone else&#8217;s happiness before mine. </p>\n<p>I hope to be in the practice of hypercrisy, where it is normal for people to treat me worse than how I treat them, and when people treat me in the same manner, that&#8217;s like flowers from heaven. </p>\n<p>I know some people would admire the guy in the film a lot. I actually don&#8217;t. </p>\n<p>I just felt all his happiness and his pains, and I felt a true connection with him. Sometimes watching other people can allow you to understand what makes yourself happy in life.</p>\n",

Even as I write the post, Facebook is down.</p>\n<p>I checked out the Twitter Search Stream for Facebook and it seems like hundreds of people are complaining about the same thing.</p>\n<p>It looked like Facebook not only copied the Twitter Stream, but also imported the Fail Whale into their system. Maybe they can call it the Face Whale?</p>\n<h3>Facebook changed its format to combat Twitter</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the reason why Facebook made its switch is because it feels a little bit threatened by Twitter. Not too long ago, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081124/when-twitter-met-facebook-the-acquisition-deal-that-fail-whaled/\" mce_href=\"http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081124/when-twitter-met-facebook-the-acquisition-deal-that-fail-whaled/\" target=\"_blank\"> Facebook even tried to buy Twitter</a> with their $15 Billion valuation stock&#8221;. Unfortunately, Facebook got a cold rejection.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/trans.gif?ssl=1\" mce_src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/trans.gif?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"mceWPmore mceItemNoResize\" title=\"More...\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/>Now the game is on.</p>\n<p>Facebook thinks that, &#8220;Well, since we have all these users and we already have all the social data of people, lets just copy what makes Twitter popular and <a href=\"http://www.websitemagazine.com/content/blogs/website_magazine_consumer_corner/archive/2009/03/05/5-reasons-the-new-look-facebook-could-sink-twitter.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> People will never find a reason to use Twitter anymore.</a></p>\n<p>This is in one sense logical, because Facebook does have a lot of user data, and I sometimes hear people say &#8220;why would I want to use Twitter when I already use Facebook?&#8221;</p>\n<p>So now your feeds and even your Facebook Wall look like Twitter&#8217;s Tweet Stream. Is Facebook the best thing in the world now?</p>\n<p>Not really.</p>\n<p>Even though Facebook and Twitter try to serve very similar purposes &#8211; becoming more connected with people you care about &#8211; they are completely different animals. <span mce_name=\"strong\" mce_style=\"font-weight: bold;\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Twitter&#8217;s uniqueness still lies in:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span mce_name=\"strong\" mce_style=\"font-weight: bold;\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">It is cleaner and more refined</span></li>\n<li><span mce_name=\"strong\" mce_style=\"font-weight: bold;\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">It is more open and exploratory</span></li>\n<li><span mce_name=\"strong\" mce_style=\"font-weight: bold;\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">It highlights relationships based on merit, not friendship</span></li>\n<li><span mce_name=\"strong\" mce_style=\"font-weight: bold;\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">It is a constantly engaging game of gaining more merit and creating value</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span mce_name=\"strong\" mce_style=\"font-weight: bold;\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\"></span></p>\n<h3>1. Twitter strips out a lot of automated junk and presents cleaner information</h3>\n<p>Compared to Twitter, we all know that there&#8217;s a lot more stuff you can pull from the Facebook Stream because of all the activities that are going on in Facebook.</p>\n<p>However, nowadays we don&#8217;t necessarily lack information. We lack the tools that help us refine information. </p>\n<p>The truth is that a lot of the interesting things on the internet does not happen on Facebook. When you look at the Facebook Feeds, there&#8217;s a ton of auto-generated stuff that are exclusively about Facebook. You rarely find good articles on Facebook through the Facebook Feeds or some breaking news hours before it is covered by a news source because all you see on the FB Feed is how many pictures your friends uploaded and who changed their profile pictures.</p>\n<p>In Twitter, people pull in all kinds of information, sites, news, and resources from all over the internet. These are things they have deemed worthy of their followers to consume. And since people can easily opt-out of your Tweets (will cover later), everyone actually has some sort of quality control pressure, unlike Facebook.</p>\n<p>Twitter clears out all the photo uploads, events, Zombie bites, and just tells you what your friends want to tell you in 140 characters.</p>\n<h3>2. Information on Twitter is more open than Facebook, making it more adventurous</h3>\n<p>The Twitter platform is way more open than Facebook. On Twitter, you get to know exactly what&#8217;s been discussed in the Twittersphere immediately. You can find out what&#8217;s on the mind of people in that community at any given moment.</p>\n<p>On Facebook, you have to be peoples&#8217; friends to know what&#8217;s going on in your circle. Obviously that&#8217;s not a bad thing because a lot of people just care about their real life friends.</p>\n<p>However, Twitter allows you to explore a whole new world of cool stuff, cool people, and opportunities for you to discover and absorb. Through tons of Twitter Apps, you are able to find interesting people in any particular industry, in your location, celebrities that you care about who won&#8217;t friend you on Facebook, and all sorts of fun information.</p>\n<p>Being on Twitter is definitely more like an adventure compared to Facebook&#8217;s Shire-nature of hanging out with your Hobbit friends.</p>\n<h3>3. One-Way Followships on Twitter Enhances Experience for both Tweeters and Followers</h3>\n<p>Another unique advantage Twitter has is the one-way followship. On Facebook, there may be a lot of information that you don&#8217;t really care about from friends. However, since most of them are your real friends, its not very socially acceptable to opt out of that by unfriending them.</p>\n<p>On Twitter, since <span mce_name=\"strong\" mce_style=\"font-weight: bold;\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">people follow each other based on merit more often than existing friendship</span>, you follow people because you enjoy what they tweet, instead of if you are acquaintances in real life.</p>\n<p>If someone starts to tweet a lot of junk, its an easy unfollow for everyone. You only see what you want to see.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, because people can easily unfollow you if you are tweeting trash, people on Twitter have more pressure to tweet out things that are more interesting&#8230;at least according to themselves.</p>\n<p>Every time you Tweet, you risk someone clicking the unfollow button. This makes most people tweet seriously.</p>\n<h3>4. Follower Acquisition makes Twittering a constantly-engaging game</h3>\n<p>Because of the one-way nature of Twitter, a lot of people begin to treat this as a fun game to &#8220;earn&#8221; the followship of more followers.</p>\n<p>On Facebook, if you invite a lot of people, you will probably get a lot of friends. But on Twitter it doesn&#8217;t work this way. You can follow everyone, and no one needs to follow you back.</p>\n<p>In that sense, having a follower on Twitter is way more meaningful than having a new friend on Facebook. You &#8220;earn&#8221; your right to become follow-worthy, and I can guarantee that seeing a new follower on Twitter feels MUCH better than having a random guy request to be your friend on Facebook.</p>\n<p>Because of that, there are a lot of people who work very hard to seem interesting, tweet out quality information, and find funny/witty things to say, all just to delight and entertain people so they can become more &#8220;follow-worthy&#8221;. No one works this hard to get friends on Facebook.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion: Different Tools for Different Purposes</h3>\n<p>I actually don&#8217;t dislike Facebook. I use it and like it a lot. However, by nature, Facebook will not (and I will argue never) replace Twitter even if it has the same layout and function.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Twitter will not replace Facebook either. They should not even try by adding in more information, a larger profile page, and allowing more pictures. The beauty of Twitter lies in its limitations, instead of how much it encompasses.</p>\n<p>Facebook is about maintaining a stronger relationship with existing friends, whereas Twitter is like an engaging game where you are constantly learning new things, exploring new fields and attracting new followers.</p>\n",

You can still deal with fulltime jobs, school, or other things since there is a lot of flexibility.</p>\n<h3>II. The business runs you</h3>\n<p>After a certain point, you start to lose control of the progress of the company. Tasks arise by itself in the business: your customers are demanding service, your employees need direction, problems need to be solved. At this point you can&#8217;t choose to stop working or work slowly, because this world does not wait for you, and being slow on progress simply means death for the company.</p>\n<h3>III. The business runs itself</h3>\n<p>Hopefully, after a lot of hard work, you will reach the point where the business runs itself. Systems are set up, revenue streams in, employees not what to do. If you take a vacation and come back, the business would become stronger itself. This is when you can fully work ON your business, not IN your business (thank you <a title=\"E-Myth\" href=\"http://www.e-myth.com/pub/htdocs/about\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Michael Gerber</strong></a>).

It basically is saying that <strong>Obama is a puppet of an elitest group called the <a title=\"Bilderberger\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderbergers\" target=\"_blank\">Bilderberg Group</a> and is planning to create a single world government that controls everything.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">One of the latest &#8220;evidence&#8221; regarding this theory is that Obama has nominated Kansas Gov. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Sebelius\" target=\"_blank\">Kathleen Sebelius</a>, a Bilderberg attendee, as the Health and Human Services Secretary.</p>\n<h3 class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">What is The Bilderberg Group?</h3>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>The Bilderberg Group is an unofficial annual invitation-only conference/forum of between 100-150 guests, most of whom are persons of influence in the fields of politics, business, and finance.</strong> The Bilderberg folks have been meeting once every 4 years and they have been doing it since 1954.</p>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Recently conspiracy theorists claimed that because Obama&#8217;s campaign has a lot of people who are Bilderberg attendees, and so he himself is controlled by the Bilderberg Group</strong>. The biggest punch from that statement comes from a video called <a href=\"http://www.obamadeception.net/\" target=\"_blank\">The Obama Deception</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Why Bilderberger?</h3>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>The big issue about the Bilderberg Group is that it is completely secret. </strong>No reporters are allowed, the attendee list is not published, and there are no press releases that go in detail what they talk about. They probably believe in &#8220;What happens in Bilderberg stays in Bilderberg&#8221; more than our Vegas crazy friends. While keeping it secret is all warm and fuzzy, the world gets stressed about things like that. Powerful people gathering in secrecy is like a kid&#8217;s parents grouping together and whispering something in secret. They have a lot of power over the kid, and they don&#8217;t want the kid to know what they&#8217;re thinking.</p>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Other conferences like Davos and <a title=\"Council on Foreign Relations\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations\">Council on Foreign Relations</a> are all quite transparent, unlike the stealthy nature of the Bilderberg Group. For this reason, the Bilderberg Group has been getting some catchy descriptions like &#8220;the most powerful manipulators of society&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EE22Ak03.html\" target=\"_blank\">Masters of the Universe</a>&#8221; that are taking us &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.nexusmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=6\" target=\"_blank\">towards a One World Empire</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3 class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">What I think about the Bilderberg Group</h3>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">First of all, I want to say that I am not an expert about the Bilderberg Group. I hear a few things here and there, and my opinions may be incorrect. Nevertheless, <strong>I feel like this Bilderberg conspiracy is way overstretched.</strong> The simple idea is that people who actually get to make a difference can gather together, discuss ideas, problems and solutions, without actually being afraid of what they can say and discuss. When you have a lot of power, the press is always following your tail, you rarely get to say what you truly think and want to discuss, and a lot of political communications is just a show to the public.</p>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><strong>Am I saying that the Bilderberg Group is not trying to created a more unified central government? No.</strong> A lot of people with power have thoughts of trying to centralize things to increase efficiency and avoid conflict. Obviously that&#8217;s not popular nor &#8220;democratic,&#8221; but its one of those politically incorrect things that you can think but can&#8217;t really express.</p>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">That doesn&#8217;t mean they are plotting towards that. I have a lot of European friends who say things like &#8220;too bad there wasn&#8217;t something in the past that united all the countries in Europe.&#8221; People think things like that, but do they do something about it? Not necessarily. <strong>If the Bilderberg Group was really trying to do something like that and if they were really &#8220;Masters of the Universe&#8221;, won&#8217;t you think that they would have gotten some progress already over half a century?</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Obama and the Bilderberger Group</h3>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Why would Obama nominate people in the Bilderberg Group? Well, the nature of power is that when you are influential and connected, everyone wants you to be part of them. If you look at the business world, most people only sit on the board of 1-2 companies. But there are these super high-level characters that sit on the board of over a dozen Fortune 500 companies. That&#8217;s because everyone invites you when you have achieved that status.</p>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">The same holds true here. <strong>Whoever the Bilderberg Group invites to their forum must be someone that is highly influential, competent and important.</strong> Is it that big of a deal that Obama likes people who are highly influential, competent and important too? Should there be a rule that once a person is invited to the Bilderberg Group, the President should not ever associate with him/her again? That&#8217;s ridiculous. If that is the case, then the most powerful thing the Bilderberg Group can do IS to actually invite all the best people in the states, preventing the President&#8217;s Cabinet from utilizing the abilities of these highly competent people.</p>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">My final conclusion? Even IF the Bilderberg Group wanted world domination and to create a central government, just the fact that Obama nominates a few of their attendees does not mean Obama endorses that. <strong>Saying that &#8220;Obama is a puppet of the Bilderberg Group&#8221; based on those facts is quite stretched and, though being a good marketing/viral plot, makes them less credible in my mind. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Either way, I feel that it is quite irresponsible for people to bring up points that unsettle the crowd and destroys the unity and growth of the country just for their publicity. Even if it were all true, I think right when the president is elected is a TERRIBLE time to disclose it.</p>\n<p class=\"storyheaderlarge\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">I know this is quite a controversial topic (since it is about controversies and conspiracies itself), so you may not agree with me. I may be wrong, and we&#8217;ll see if the next few days of investigation prove that or not. What do YOU think about Obama and the Bilderberg Group?</p>\n",

Obviously there are lots of projects that they failed at, but some are really just killer apps.</p>\n<p>Now especially with the Google Phone and others, voice.google.com will likely become their next big hit, and I&#8217;m excited to see how they will do.</p>\n<h3>Features of voice.google.com</h3>\n<p>Check out these voice.google.com features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('_DRGMOXMSmM', 'Call screening');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Call screening</a> &#8211; Announce and screen callers</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('EUDTxfnF4kU', 'Listen in');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Listen in</a> &#8211; Listen before taking a call</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('AEIf_Ndwzcg', 'Block calls');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Block calls</a> &#8211; Keep unwanted callers at bay</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('zpgMJ7Hv6tk', 'SMS');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">SMS</a> &#8211; Send, receive, and store SMS</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('sHIWUw6cf1U', 'Place calls');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Place calls</a> &#8211; Call US numbers for free</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('vDo6hkgoYXo', 'Taking calls');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Taking calls</a> &#8211; Answer on any of your phones</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('ziUgaesO6Gs', 'Phone routing');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Phone routing</a> &#8211; Phones ring based on who calls</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('F7nMoAmjbms', 'Forwarding phones');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Forwarding phones</a> &#8211; Add phones and decide which ring</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('oFVXAqFNgic', 'Voicemail transcripts');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Voicemail transcripts</a> &#8211; Read what your voicemail says</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('kq33UDLaAtc', 'Listen to voicemail');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Listen to voicemail</a> &#8211; Check online or from your phone</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('gtsgTZRCTZE', 'Notifications');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Notifications</a> &#8211; Receive voicemails via email or SMS</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('csX5EhElgZc', 'Personalize greeting');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Personalize greeting</a> &#8211; Vary greetings by caller</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('IuE6hb9oW_M', 'Share voicemail');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Share voicemail</a> &#8211; Forward or download voicemails</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('4zY00-KBaog', 'Conference calling');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Conference calling</a> &#8211; Join people into a single call</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('LipDc2sFvQY', 'Call record');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Call record</a> &#8211; Record calls and store them online</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('3VgJVFajgEw', 'Call switch');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Call switch</a> &#8211; Switch phones during a call</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('1tw5yxxoz2I', 'Mobile site');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Mobile site</a> &#8211; View your inbox from your mobile</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('Whc9rj0Yqf0', 'GOOG-411');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">GOOG-411</a> &#8211; Check directory assistance</li>\n<li> <a onclick=\"openMovieDialog('UI4mhLZSyB8', 'Manage groups');\" href=\"https://www.google.com/voice/about#\">Manage groups</a> &#8211; Set preferences by group</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>voice.google.com only available for GrandCentral users</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, when they launch in a few weeks, they will only be available to GrandCentral (a phone management service bought by Google) users.</p>\n<p>It seems like they are treating this like Google Wifi, where at the beginning as an experiment, Google opened up free wifi to all residents in Mountain View to see if free internet results in more ad-words clicking revenue from that area.</p>\n<h3>Will update this post as soon as I get more info from voice.google.com</h3>\n<p>This is a pretty new product, and there&#8217;s not a lot out there yet.

When I was a second year in college, I remember my friend Eric Dong hosting it at UCLA. I was quite surprised when I got the invitation to speak at one though. There&#8217;s another reason for blogging \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>I believe last year it was hosted at Stanford, and this year it is hosted at USC (I hope they don&#8217;t throw rocks at me&#8230;). I&#8217;ve been thinking about a little what I would talk about and here&#8217;s I came up with:</p>\n<p>I will talk about my experiences growing up in a variety of continents and becoming a social entrepreneur. Being from a diplomat family, I grew up in Taiwan, South Africa, Kansas and California, adapting to constantly changing environments. The talk will include how that background led me to start my first business first year of college, and how other students can become entrepreneurs too.</p>\n<p>Also, I will introduce the FD Lifestyle: how to convert life into a game that you love and must master. I will then discuss how to strive in a glass ceiling society by empowering through social media and personal branding. Finally, I will share some ideas regarding some important trends in the future such as sustainability/green, social media, and virtual worlds.</p>\n<p>If you are Taiwanese and in the Socal area, be sure to sign up for the event too \ud83d\ude42</p>\n",

Through that I have met a lot of great people like Aminata, Lily, and Jason.</p>\n<p>As you guys know by now, I have a very explain-y style, which results in longer posts. I tend to pack a lot of information into one blogpost, and that makes my blog a bit tougher for reader adaption compared to<a href=\"http://junloayza.com\" target=\"_blank\"> Jun&#8217;s</a> short and friendly blogposts. It also takes me a long time to write these posts, which is tough when you are an entrepreneur that works 90 hours a week.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I contemplate if time spent on this blog is worth it, since it takes hundreds or even thousands of hours of committed work without much ROI to it. However, its times like that when I suddenly get the most encouraging messages from readers. I want to include here one that completely made my day last week. This particular one is from Facebook:</p>\n<p><!--more--><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Hi Yu-kai,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">I really wish I found your blog earlier in my life, but I am glad I found it now and hopefully can act on your advice. Your blog is inspiring. I graduated from UCLA with an International Economics degree too but I did far less than what you had accomplished. And your essay on UCLA career service is absolutely correct. When I was an econ major, the school pushed and advertised the Big 4 accounting jobs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Anyhow, long story short, I always wanted to start a business but did not have the guts to start. So I worked as a CPA for 2 years at a hedge fund and then went to law school since I enjoy schooling a lot. So now I am doing my last semester in London, and the funny thing is that traveling liberated me and made me realize I may want to be an entrepreneur again. I think there may be a similarity between traveling and being entrepreneur in that you have to deal with the unknown and still be confident that things will work out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Considering my huge debt, I will most likely be slaving away at a large law firm for a few years, but I will have 5 months after the bar to do whatever I want and I think it will be an ideal time to test out my skills at dropforme.com and travel around the world (yes, with debt).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Thanks!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Can I add you as a friend?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">(name omitted)</span></p>\n<p>When I get messages and notes like these, every single piece of doubt in my mind is wiped out and it becomes a &#8220;duh! Of course you should keep writing.&#8221; It goes back to the basic principle of &#8220;money can&#8217;t get you love, but putting your heart into something can.&#8221; When I blog, I sincerely put my reader&#8217;s welfare in mind (not that I do a great job about it or anything, but I try). I know you who sent me the message will read this post too, so thank you so much for writing that!</p>\n<p>So for everyone else out there, if you happen to be reading my blog, message me! I know for some, it&#8217;s kinda outside of their comfort zones, but check out my post on how that&#8217;s just a Harmless Dragon \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>I PROMISE you that if you get in touch with me, we will be friends.</p>\n<p>Have an extraordinary week and become successful in every activity you engage in!</p>\n",

        },
        "content": {
            "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>In the past few years, I have moved quite regularly as an entrepreneur nomad. I realized that most of the time, when people want a new house/apartment, they base it on the first five seconds they walk into the place. They either love it or they don&#8217;t. If those five seconds were phenomenal, then it&#8217;s time to check if the price is affordable.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of non-obvious things that you\u00a0 may not check but one-way or another impacts your quality of everyday life while you live there.</p>\n<h3>1. The Shower</h3>\n<p>Most people just check if the water works properly when checking out the bathroom. However, one of the things you should check is <strong>how long does it take the water to become hot</strong>. A good shower experience can dramatically change your attitude during the day. Some places take a long time for the water to warm up, and you not only waste a lot of water at a time when water might be in deficit, you end up waiting cold and naked in the bathroom for longer when you are in need for that refreshing feeling.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, how powerful the shower is should take a big part of your shower experience too. Showers that have nice massaging power is much better in getting you relaxed and refreshed than ones that just &#8220;get you wet.&#8221;</p>\n<h3><!--more-->2. Placement of Light switches</h3>\n<p>When you check out a new home, make sure the light switches are placed intuitively in terms of daily activity flows. You don&#8217;t want to be maneuvering across the room in the dark looking for the switches. Nor do you want to turn off the light switch and walk through darkness to find your way out of the room.</p>\n<p>If a room has two entrances, it should have two light switches. It also shouldn&#8217;t be at a spot where you need to &#8220;look around the corner&#8221; to find. <strong>The switch should be where you are, instead of you going to the light switch.</strong></p>\n<h3>3. Cellphone reception and internet connectivity</h3>\n<p>This is a big thing that a lot of people don&#8217;t check enough. There are many apartments and houses that have terrible cellphone reception. You don&#8217;t want to live everyday of your life at home leaving your phone next to the window, or needing to walk outside the apartment just to have a regular phone conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>When you visit a potential home, walk around with your cellphone and check if you have healthy reception everywhere.</strong> You should need to go out just to stay connected.</p>\n<h3>4. Daytime Lighting</h3>\n<p>If possible, check if the house is positioned so that during the daytime, there is enough sunlight in the place. During the daytime, you don&#8217;t want to turn on the lights, but <strong>the quality of your activities will greatly be impact by the lighting around</strong>. That&#8217;s also why some libraries &#8220;feel&#8221; more productive than others.</p>\n<p>Also, it&#8217;s good to have an understanding if the house is too hot in the morning or in the evening. I have been in places where half of the house is burning hot in the morning and the other half is just as hot during the evening. Unfortunately, since I was sharing the place with some hosts, I was not able to choose where I want to be when I want to.</p>\n<h3>5. The Manager/Landlord</h3>\n<p>The manager or landlord will greatly impact your experience while staying there. Is your manager flaky? Does he seem like he cares about the tenants? A bad manager can get you into a lot of trouble during times of emergencies, especially when something important breaks or if you have lost your keys.</p>\n<p>One of my apartment managers in the past only responds a week after you try to get in touch with him because of his side business and bad smoking behaviors. Not only did he never fix anything that was broken in the apartment, it gave me a lot of problems when the garage door belt broke and I became immobile for an entire week.</p>\n<p>The only way to figure this out is to evaluate your conversations with the manager and talk to other people who live there. If you are going to be living at a place for a couple years, it&#8217;s worth it to do your due diligence and knock on some potential neighbors&#8217; doors to really figure out the ins and outs here.</p>\n<h3>More ideas from readers?</h3>\n<p>Can you think of anything else that is non-obvious but important to look for when finding a new place? Are there things in your place that annoys you a lot that you wished you checked for earlier? Please leave them in the comment section to discuss. We would all LOVE to hear about your experiences and learn from your insights.</p>\n",

What do we have in our sleeves?</p>\n<p>Well, you guys may already know we&#8217;re working on what we think could be an industry-changing site called Viralogy. Viralogy aims to help personal bloggers become discovered and also create a Social Media Rank. While we&#8217;re still getting out of our Alpha stage (with strangers playing with it), we are excited to first launch a new project called Awesome Bloggers.</p>\n<p><!--more-->Since our site is about promoting bloggers, we decided that we want to interview the best bloggers out there for tips and personalities that can benefit other aspiring bloggers. You can find their text everywhere, but very rarely do you get to see them talk in real life. We want to break down some barriers and create a real relationship with these bloggers and their readers.</p>\n<p>If you are a blogger and want to be interviewed on the show (remotely through Skype), let us know!</p>\n<p>Also, we want to teach companies how to use blogging as a good business tool too (you can&#8217;t imagine how many of those firms who don&#8217;t understand any of this and are asking about Social Media Marketing all the time). That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re creating http://probusinessblogger.com. Companies basically sign up for monthly video tutorials for $100/month. If you want to earn some extra cash, we give referrers or sales folks 50% commission. We made the product, and we will make as much as the person who wells it. This means that if you get 20 companies to buy, you will get $1000 passive income on a monthly basis without doing anything else. No pressure but contact me if you see that as an opportunity.</p>\n<p>Life is extraordinary as an entrepreneur, and there are exciting things going on with Future Delivery. Will we fail at many of the things we do? Sure! But just like a video game, you have to die quite a few times before you can beat the game. Its WAY better than not playing the game at all \ud83d\ude42</p>\n",

Figure out what you want to do, find people who have complementary skills to do it with you, and learn everything you can from the internet.&#8221; Then they&#8217;ll usually follow up with &#8220;But I don&#8217;t have a lot of money or any great ideas. Isn&#8217;t it very risky?&#8221;</p>\n<h3> You don&#8217;t need a lot of money or a great idea to be an entrepreneur</h3>\n<p>Many people have the false impression that they need a lot of money and a great idea to be an entrepreneur. That&#8217;s actually not true. Sure, its risky, but if you don&#8217;t have much money, what&#8217;s there to lose? Since I was 18, I started an online retailing company selling electronic products, a company that imports components of construction machinery (didn&#8217;t take off due to partnership misalignment in values), a non-profit for professional networking services, a small business consulting company, the premiere business organization in UCLA (not really a company, so consider that taking a break), Future Delivery and the company I have right now, RewardMe.</p>\n<h3> The first step towards entrepreneurship could be small</h3>\n<p>When I first started, I obviously didn&#8217;t have any money. The whole thing came as an accident when I raffled myself two football tickets and sold them on eBay. I felt something was lightened up within me, as if I have found a calling. So then I decided to trade TI-83 Calculators, which is something everyone needs for school. I would go on eBay during hours when everyone was asleep so I can buy the calculators without anyone bidding against me, and I would sell them during times when there were a lot of bid competition. If you used eBay before, you know it&#8217;s all about how many people are bidding against each other when your listing ends. Just like that, I would buy a calculator for $40 at 2AM, and then sell it for $60 at 1PM. A pretty good margin.</p>\n<p>However, I was not satisfied. I kept finding people on eBay selling brand new products that are a lot cheaper than retail prices, and I wanted to do that too. I thought that these people must have bought in bulk and I would never be able to compete with them. But I lightened up when I found out about Dropshipping.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>Dropshipping is perfect for College Students </h3>\n<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shipping\" target=\"_blank\">Dropshipping</a> is actually something pretty nifty. It allows you to go on eBay and sell any/all the products that your supplier lists BEFORE you buy the items. Once you have sold the merchandise to someone, guaranteeing a buyer, you THEN order it from your supplier with wholesale price. The supplier then sends the merchandise directly from its inventory to the customer, while printing your company&#8217;s name onto it as the seller. In this way, you don&#8217;t have any upfront costs except the small listing fees on eBay, you don&#8217;t have to deal with inventory, you only spend money when you already have products sold, you learn the ins and outs of running a business, and you get to promote your brand online.</p>\n<h3> Finding the right supplier is essential for retail businesses </h3>\n<p>As a first year in college, I was looking for a lot of quality dropship suppliers. They were really hard to find because most of them were either not very reliable, or they would be <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">middleman companies</span> that pretended to be a supplier when they were only a broker. Most real dropshipping suppliers have a ninja secrecy agreement not to promote themselves so they don&#8217;t steal business away from their established dropshipper customers. I had to go through a lot of research and Better Business Bureau data to finally come up with 2-3 decent dropshippers that sold electronic products like iPods, Digital Cameras, GPS and what not for a decent price. Just like that, I was making some decent revenue as a full-time student at UCLA. What makes it even better, is that I also bought all types of products with wholesale prices for my personal use. Running a dropshipping business not only creates an opportunity to make a profit, but also allows you to buy everything you need in life at a cheaper price.</p>\n<h3> Running a company is still hard work </h3>\n<p>One thing I must say is that running any type of business is not easy. It never is. You need to make sure you have the right marketing strategy and pricing strategy, deal with customers (both happy and angry), do some bookkeeping, and talk to suppliers when problems like backordering happens. I loved it because the hard work made me want to wake up everyday in the morning and make my business even better. It gave me the education and thrill that school could never provide.</p>\n<h3> One opportunity leads into another </h3>\n<p>As I was running my business, I developed a reputation among my network as being the entrepreneurial guy. After awhile, everyone who had any kind of business idea came to me for advice, and I would talk to them about marketing, operations, legal structures and the likes. As time went by, I slowly moved on from Dropshipping to other opportunities as they were presented to me, but I felt I would never be where I am today without the dropshipping experience. It made running a business less intimating and got me excited about the entrepreneurial lifestyle.</p>\n<h3> Some students make a good 5-digit income doing dropshipping part-time </h3>\n<p>When my college or corporate friends ask me about what&#8217;s a good way to start testing the waters of running their own business, I usually recommend them to start with dropshipping (and read Michael Gerber&#8217;s E-Myth Revisited). You can do it highly part-time, and it allows you to see if running a business is for you. My good friend Joseph also started his dropshipping business in college, and he made over $30,000 in profits in a year doing it part-time. Hands down to him.</p>\n<p>There are obviously more ways to start off as an entrepreneur. Some people do the network marketing pyramid stuff, some people do consulting, and others go straight to high tech. Dropshipping is just one of the easiest ways to see if the entrepreneurial lifestyle is for you. Even though I strongly recommend it, you should do whatever floats your boat.</p>\n",

CINA was hosting their annual conference (The Cinacon), where a bunch of entrepreneurs set up booths and showcase their companies and pitch to VCs. I first got the newsletter from CINA regarding the event, but since I have a busy schedule and it costs money to join (yea, we&#8217;re leanest of the leanest right now), I did not respond to it. Weeks later, she called me and urged me to sign up and join. After two times of her calling just to encourage me to join, I OKed it.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>The Set Up of the Startup Presentation</h3>\n<p>The set up goes like this. All the startups will have their tables, where they can set up all their fancy equipment, brochures, booklets and little snacks to look cool like a company. There are then companies who are doing the &#8220;Showcase,&#8221; which means they&#8217;re at the farend wall, making a 10-min presentation. People can sit down and listen, or they can just wander around the booths and not care. Over a dozen of them are showcasing their companies. Finally, there is a session where entrepreneurs have close to 10 minute to present their companies to a group of 20-25 Venture Capitalists in a closed room.</p>\n<h3>My Preparation for the Startup Presentation</h3>\n<p>Honestly, for the past few days I have been pretty busy. I have been doing a few projects and doing some consulting work, especially regarding a Twitter project with a client. I thought I would take the entire day before the Cinacon to create the perfect pitch. Unfortunately at the time, I happened to get into a huge fight with my girlfriend (who is the most wonderful girl in the world), extending from the day before. Some discouraging words from my co-founder earlier that day didn&#8217;t help either. After some issues and handling some other work, it was already 5PM. Oh no! Time for meeting with this friend/client and discuss this project. It will probably last 1 hour, and I can get back to work.</p>\n<p>The meeting was very productive and fulfilling, except when I was done, it was 9PM already. Gosh, I haven&#8217;t started making my presentation yet, and I need to 1. turn in my slides by tonight, and 2. be there at the conference at 11AM the next day. At 9PM, I started working on my presentation, while talking to my girlfriend on the phone (a closure conversation that made both of us feel good and just want to talk longer with that after-surviving-the-storm feeling). At that time, I was trying to go along with the presentation guidelines that the organization gave me, which was 7 slides, just briefing over the necessary information. I thought it was a requirement and every company will use this &#8220;template&#8221; and felt I needed to conform.</p>\n<p>However, after trying to put in the right information that wasn&#8217;t interesting or engaging, I suddenly thought I should make my presentations in pictures and icons to make it fun (after all, FD is about being fun AND productive). Yea, my presentation might be different to everyone elses&#8217;, AND I might go over the 12-page limit, but I&#8217;m an entrepreneur and I can be different. Its not like I can get laid off for this. Plus, its nice that I&#8217;m young, because people will just think I&#8217;m &#8220;of a different generation&#8221; and maybe rebellious, whereas if I were old, people would think I&#8217;m weird or eccentric. They might shake their heads at me, but I at least want to present something I can be proud of.</p>\n<h3>Wii Fit is awesome</h3>\n<p>So by this time I was still at my friend/client&#8217;s house, and it was about 11PM. I suddenly felt extremely tired. I was sure that its because I was drained by my sadness from the fight with my girlfriend that afternoon. For some reason, being sad takes a lot of energy and exhausts you. At that time, I decided to play the Wii Fit game that my friend had, while talking to my girlfriend on the phone (gotta use that time efficiently, no?). The Wii Fit was quite kind and reminded me that it was late and sleeping too late would be bad for my health. I appreciated it, but I needed something casual to wake me up and reboost my energy. I played some balancing games, yoga, aerobics and what not. Btw, I got up to 361 spins with the hulahoop game (try to beat that). Even though I was exercising, by the time I was done, I no longer felt tired and was recharged again. The Wii Fit kindly reminded me it was late again and I should sleep. For me it was time for good work again! I worked up till 3:30AM in the morning, sent the file to CINA, and fell asleep at my friend&#8217;s place.</p>\n<h3>Before the Startup Presentation</h3>\n<p>The next morning I woke up at around 8AM. I got my stuff, and drove home. This is when I was thinking, &#8220;Hmmm&#8230;.I don&#8217;t have any company material or brochure I can show people. It would be weird if it was just me sitting there.&#8221; When I got home, I quickly typed up some information about the company and Viralogy, pasted on some images that we have, and started printing over a few hundred copies while I took a shower. I also realized that I had not had the chance to practice through my presentation once, so I don&#8217;t even know if it fits in the 10 minute time frame. I decided to practice while I am tabling it at the booth. There was actually some solo-drama here, but lets just say I left on time but got to the event an hour late.</p>\n<h3>At the Event</h3>\n<p>When I got there, I realized that everyone else had 5 monitors set up, fancy webcams and hardware, large billboards, and a few folks at each table. Boy, I&#8217;d look pretty bad. However, I remember my own lesson: &#8220;Confidence is everything minus one.&#8221; As long as I sit there and presented myself as if we were a cool company (which is true), other people will look past the lack of set up and feel the same way. I put my printed documents in a stack on the table, and then put another stack of my business cards next to it. I then would just be using my laptop and doing other work until someone comes close and asks a question. Pretty ghetto.</p>\n<h3>The Startup Presentation</h3>\n<p>When people started doing the showcase, I realized that no one else followed the exact guideline that was given to me. Whew, at least I&#8217;m not the odd ball. I also noticed that people who were presenting were like twice my age. Some of them have PhDs, and some of them have companies with good revenue already. I also realized that my presentation for both the casual showcase AND the formal VC presentation was last, which is about time peoples&#8217; brains get drained and start to drool. I figured I needed to do something for me to get a chance at anything.</p>\n<p>When it was my time to present, I got up to the microphone (why is it called &#8220;micro&#8221;-phone again? It makes your voice louder), and started to yell, &#8220;HELLO EVERYONE! I&#8217;M YU-KAI CHOU FROM REWARDME, AND I&#8217;M HERE TO PRESENT YOU OUR PRODUCT TODAY. I know everyone&#8217;s pretty tired by now, so my goal is to energize all of you so you&#8217;ll all be excited about an extraordinary evening after this.&#8221; My first job was to just wake them up. I&#8217;m not sure if this was a great thing to do, but I won some awards so I must be doing something right. I must say I learned this from my co-founder and best friend <a href=\"http://junloayza.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jun Loayza</a> as he was filming his Future Delivery TV. He taught me the way of the yell.</p>\n<h3>The Official Startup Presentation</h3>\n<p>Now it was time to do the official presentation to the two dozen VCs. They&#8217;ll also have 2 minutes to grill me on questions. After 2 years of being in this high-tech field, I already know that VCs always ask pretty similar questions, so I wasn&#8217;t particularly worried. I made the same presentation with the same intro (yes I yelled at the VCs. I actually interrupted one lady VC who was talking to another and forced her to stop just because my voice came in as a blast), and waited for their question.</p>\n<p>They asked me, again, the usual bunch: revenue model, and sustainable advantage. To be honest, we have competitive advantages, but I&#8217;m not sure that we have clear-cut sustainable advantages. We target a niche that no one else is targeting (the bottom 95% of all bloggers &#8211; those who need the most help. Blog Hubs just focus on the top 5%), but someone else can target that niche too after us. We have some nice technology and layouts, but people can duplicate it too. The only thing that people can&#8217;t steal, is the name Viralogy.com (which I think makes us sound legit), and the loyalty/reputation we have already built as the dominant personal blogger ranking site. However, the market is big enough that I think we&#8217;ll be fine without destroying other companies (400 Million and growing market is already larger than the US population).</p>\n<p>The tough thing to explain to them was our revenue model. It was complicated. Lets just say its kinda like eBay plus the reverse of Google Adsense. Confused? I don&#8217;t blame you. I actually feel that the revenue model is our most innovative feature in our new product. I don&#8217;t think anyone has done this before, but all the smartest people I explained it to said it was smart/ingenious. I know <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guy Kawasaki</a> said that VCs are ultra-scared of innovative revenue models. They like innovative technologies and products, but how they make money should be simple like selling dog food. However, I&#8217;ll disagree a little (don&#8217;t all entrepreneurs do that when the pundit disagrees with what they&#8217;re doing?). Look at Google. When Google created Google Adsense (which is what made them truly successful), I&#8217;m sure people would feel that Adsense was a very complicated model. What? People first bid for a price per word, and then others search, and then the engine detects the keywords and display your ads if you are a high bidder, and they charge you for the click*bid you gave. Oh, and you can set what&#8217;s the maximum amount of money you are willing to spend in that period. I think that was an innovative/complicated model during its time. Now try to explain that to the VCs in 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>At the end of my pitch, I simply informed that the VCs that since we make some contracted income, we are sustainable and not looking for funding. However, we would consider $100,000 to fulfill our 2009 plans. I threw out a modest valuation of $2M, considering our company has a few live products, a TV show, and a good reputation in our field already.</p>\n<h3>The Gala Dinner after the Startup Presentation</h3>\n<p>After the pitches, we had a REALLY good dinner. We listened to some incredibly successful and impactful VCs talk about the economy and how the money is still out there, but VCs are just concerned so they&#8217;re just not rushing to invest. Amonst them are Scott Chou of Gabriel Venture Partners (for some mysterious reason I particularly like &#8220;Chou&#8221;s&#8230;.), <a href=\"http://www.woodsidefund.com/about/t_vince.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vince Occhipinti</a> of Woodside Fund, Wu-Fu Chen of Acorn Campus Ventures, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/prashant-shah\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prashant Shah</a> of Hummer Winblad, and <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/ppl/webprofile?action=vmi&amp;id=18536&amp;authToken=Ew2-&amp;authType=name&amp;trk=ppro_viewmore&amp;lnk=vw_pprofile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eghosa Omoigui</a>, the Investment Director of Intel Capital. They talked about how Early Stage money has not decreased by that much based on the stats, but raising VC funds are hard to begin with and people just blame the economy when they don&#8217;t get the funding.</p>\n<h3>Awards after the Startup Presentation</h3>\n<p>So here comes the awards. They first started off with Official Presentation awards. I didn&#8217;t expect to win anything (considering my preparedness), so I was just typing at my laptop and doing some work. Suddenly I heard them call out &#8220;Future Delivery.&#8221; Gosh, it feels so good when you hear people use words/names that you invented as if it was legit and almost a matter of fact. I walked up stage and realized that it was first place for my VC official presentation. Wow, the 2 dozen VCs considered my presentation to be better than all the others. That was pretty sweet. I had 19 seconds to sum up what Viralogy does. <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/ppl/webprofile?action=vmi&amp;id=18536&amp;authToken=Ew2-&amp;authType=name&amp;trk=ppro_viewmore&amp;lnk=vw_pprofile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eghosa Omoigui</a> of Intel Capital then said that he invested in the blog company <a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Six Apart</a>, so he is quite keen of this space. He wanted to talk to me more about how can I monetize on the long tail of the blogosphere. That&#8217;s pretty awesome. As a prize, I got a golden boat model that says &#8220;The Hong Kong Science Park.&#8221; Supposedly it has some historical value, and people around me mentioned it was worth over $1000. I guess whatever floats my boat.</p>\n<p>When I got back to my seat, I was quite excited, so, uh hum, the first thing I wanted to do was to tweet this to my dear friends on Twitter. However, my Twitterfon wasn&#8217;t working. While I was calming down and being frustrated for Twitterfon, I heard my company named being called out again. I heard the organization say &#8220;Hehe, I know the results. Its pretty surprising&#8230;.Future Delivery!&#8221; Haha, what a surprise! I realized I got second place for the Show Case presentation that I did earlier. I guess the yelling DID work!</p>\n<h3>After the Presentation Awards</h3>\n<p>So after winning two of the I think six awards in total, then comes the friendly people. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have been networking and building relationships with all types of entrepreneurs and VCs before this, but this is totally different. Now people WANT to meet me before they decide if I&#8217;m a cool guy or not. Folks just appeared and asked if we could exchange business cards. When I walked up to the keynote speakers, they instantly talked to me in a welcoming way. It was a little hard not to think of myself as important when people are treating you that way, but made sure I had a grateful mentality and a new hope to work even harder in the future.</p>\n<h3>Something I learned from this Startup Presentation</h3>\n<p>Getting 1st place is an interesting experience. I have not gotten that many 1st places in my life. I have been top before, or I have been &#8220;different&#8221;/unique before, but rarely 1st. That&#8217;s almost by definition understandable. Its a good feel, but it could also build up into a very negative character growth. Being the one who is constantly moving and catching up with people when I grew up, I felt that the humility and tenacity is much better for character growth. Struggling, failing, and suffering and then getting 1st place is an awesome and fulfilling experience, but I think being 1st place continuously is not healthy for an individual.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",

Sometimes it takes the power of two to do so. After Michael Stearns got his MBA from Georgetown and came to California, he had been struggling to find a job for 8 months. His wife then decides to take matters into her own hands and created myhusbandneedsajob.com. Myhusbandneedsajob.com is simply a promotional site that sells one product: her husband.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Myhusbandneedsajob.com as creative buzz</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Notice that when the wife decided to help her husband, she did not create a site that just talks about Mike. <strong>She purposely added herself into the picture by calling it myhusbandneedsajob.com</strong> instead of just hiremike.com or something related. The first page of it is just her holding a big sign that says &#8220;Hire My Husband&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is actually really smart because there are millions of people trying to find a job for themselves, and it does not stand out. However, not that many sites are created to promote someone else, especially a spouse. myhusbandneedsajob.com is a catchy idea because women will look at it and respect how she is being so supportive of her spouse, while men out there will all tell their wives about it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>In essence, myhusbandneedsajob.com perfectly fits in the 6 concepts of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400064287?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fdca-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1400064287\" target=\"_blank\">Made to Stick</a>(an awesome book that&#8217;s worth a read): Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness,  Credibility, Emotional, and Stories</strong>. As you can see, myhusbandneedsajob.com is a simple and emotional story that qualifies for a viral campaign.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Slight problems with myhusbandneedsajob.com</h3>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Even though myhusbandneedsajob.com is a brilliant marketing plot, it still has some problems. One very obviously problem is that <strong>if you tried to type in myhusbandneedsajob.com into your url bar, it will simply take you to a spammy godaddy page</strong>. You actually have to go to http://www.myhusbandneedsajob.com/myhusbandneedsajob/Welcome.html to see the content, which means the site is not set up well for direct traffic. Millions of people can hear about myhusbandneedsajob.com and never find it. That&#8217;s like saying &#8220;in order to go on myspace.com, you need to type in myspace.com/homepage.php&#8221;. Very few people will do that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another problem is the negative association that people may get when they see such a site. Employers will all know that Mike was not able to find a job for 8 months, despite full-time job seeking efforts. Some of them may feel &#8220;there must be something wrong with him.&#8221; If it was just a normal interview, Mike&#8217;s strengths would be highlight. But under this setting, his struggles are highlighted and it would almost seem like a sympathy hire.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I feel like the company would just rather hire the wife instead for the smart marketing move. Also, myhusbandneedsajob.com may be embarrassing to Mike in the sense that he couldn&#8217;t find a job himself and needed to rely on his wife. This may affect some of the employers too.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why myhusbandneedsajob.com will work</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reason why I think <strong>myhusbandneedsajob.com will work is because of the publicity.</strong> I already said that it upholds to all Made to Stick requirements, and it will become well-known. This becomes quite useful for companies in terms of marketing and branding.<strong> In essence, they won&#8217;t be hiring Mike for his unique abilities (obviously that counts too), but they will hire him to get good publicity by being the company that hires Mike from myhusbandneedsajob.com.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is like during the older days of eBay, this online casino website would constantly buy the dumbest things for a ridiculous high price, like &#8220;magic biscuit for $2000&#8221;, &#8220;empty folder for $200&#8221;. They did it not because they are stupid or value the goods. Its because spending $6000 buying a broken time machine is a great way to get people to find out about them. In the same reason, myhusbandneedsajob.com will probably become successful and accomplish its goals of getting Mike hired.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Further Development of myhusbandneedsajob.com</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I actually think that perhaps Mike doesn&#8217;t even need to find a job. After a successful traffic pump, the couple could actually convert the entire site into a web community where people promote their spouses in hopes of finding a job. Most of the time building a site is not the biggest challenge. Its getting the publicity. If they have already gotten that publicity, then making a site that makes ad revenue would generate some money for them. Although I&#8217;m not entirely convinced that this concept is sustainable in the longrun (probably more of a support group then a real &#8220;find a good job place&#8221;), I dont think good traffic and publicity should be wasted. What do you guys think about the potentials of myhusbandneedsajob.com in that light?</p>\n",

It has been getting a lot of attention on <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?q=the+912+project&amp;date=2009-3-13&amp;sa=X\" target=\"_blank\">Google Trends</a> and Twitter. I decided to investigate it a little bit and wanted to share what I found.</p>\n<p>After some investigation, I realized the actual website <a href=\"http://www.the912project.com\">the912project.com</a> was down due to the high traffic. So many people were enthusiastic about the project, it actually crashed the Fox servers 5 times! Quite impressive. Now this is something that I really want to find out.</p>\n<h3>What is The912Project.com?</h3>\n<p>After a good amount of research (actually quite difficult), I found the best summary about the 912 Project on Mahalo:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Project 912 is the brain child of conservative talk show host and radio personality Glenn Beck. According to the website, the origin of the title is in remembrance of the 9-11 terrorist attacks. The program was revealed on becks Special <em>You Are Not ALone</em> on March 13, 2009. Beck encouraged viewers to send in photographs of themselves, and the site created an art piece of a man holding a flag with the script &#8220;We the People&#8221; printed on the bottom.&#8221;<br />\n<strong><br />\nThe idea of theProject912.com is that since right now the world is in chaos, people need to go back to their true essence.</strong> This essence can be summed up as the 9 Principles and 12 Values. A lot of the 9 Principles and 12 Values were taken out of religious text, Founding Father writings, and some common sense.</p>\n<p><!--more-->Obviously TheProject912.com is a movement more from the conservative side of the population, but I feel many of the Principles resonate with anyone who is unfirm about life because of all the uncontrollable circumstances and be able to create that solid core to live by again. The resonance is shown from the massive amount of people who sent their pictures to be part of the project, which actually is quite out of the way.</p>\n<h3>The 9 Principles of theProject912.com</h3>\n<p><strong>According to theproject912.com, people need to send an email with their pictures attached to <a href=\"mailto:wesurroundthem@foxnews.com\">wesurroundthem@foxnews.com</a> if they believe 7 or more of the following</strong>:</p>\n<p><span id=\"intelliTXT\">1. America is good place, not perfect, but good.</span></p>\n<p>2. I believe in God and He is the center of my life.</p>\n<p>3. I must try to be a better, more honest person than I was yesterday.</p>\n<p>4. The family is sacred. My spouse and I are the ultimate authority.</p>\n<p>5. If you break the law you pay the penalty. Justice is blind and no one is above it.</p>\n<p>6. I have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness and not a guarantee of equal results.</p>\n<p>7. I work hard for what I have. I will share it with who I want to. Government cannot force me to be charitable.</p>\n<p>8. It is not un-American for me to disagree or share my personal opinion.</p>\n<p>9. The government works for me. I do not answer to them. They answer to me.</p>\n<h3>The 12 Values of theProject912.com</h3>\n<p>According to theproject912.com, these are the 12 Values that Americans have kept for a couple centuries but has been lost in recent decades:</p>\n<p><span id=\"intelliTXT\"><span id=\"intelliTXT\"><strong>\u2022 Honesty<br />\n\u2022 Reverence<br />\n\u2022 Hope<br />\n\u2022 Thrift<br />\n\u2022 Humility<br />\n\u2022 Charity<br />\n\u2022 Sincerity<br />\n\u2022 Moderation<br />\n\u2022 Hard work<br />\n\u2022 Courage<br />\n\u2022 Personal responsibility<br />\n\u2022 Friendship</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>Glen believes that if everyone upholds these 9 Principles and 12 Values, we can survive through any crisis. What do you guys think about the912Project.com? Would you send a picture to him because of the project?</p>\n",

It was probably a company owned van, but I was also reminded of the Geek Squad Beetles that I see every once in awhile and some other company painted cars.</p>\n<p>This got me thinking.</p>\n<p>I noticed that paintings or signs on cars often get noticed. People even look at other people&#8217;s car license plates.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Basically, these cars get a lot of eyeballs.</span><br />\n</p>\n<h3>The social media way of marketing offline</h3>\n<p>Applying my background in Social Media Marketing, I came up with a new marketing idea that is low cost but highly effective.</p>\n<p>This is how it works:</p>\n<p>A company creates a program, where they would advertise on the cars of people who commute long distances everyday.</p>\n<p>They can pay a couple hundred dollars to these people every month to do the exact same things they would be doing anyway.</p>\n<p>Heck, instead of paying money, this company could just offer to pay all their gas bills.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h3>Social Media is about everyone being a publisher</h3>\n<p>I include this as social media marketing because the essence of social media is that everyone can be a publisher.</p>\n<p>Instead of having large budgets to publish on a billboard, everyone has their own little properties (such as blogs) and they can reach their own little niche by publishing or advertising on their little properties.</p>\n<p>I seriously think more companies should advertise on blogs because bloggers are easy to satisfy monetarily, and you seriously reach a large crowd who pay attention to you just because &#8220;Oh! This blogger found advertisers! I wonder how much is she getting paid. Maybe $50/month&#8221; &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s the same company ad on this other blog too! They&#8217;re all over the place now!&#8221;</p>\n<p>$100 to make 1000 people think you are all over the place. Not a bad deal.</p>\n<p>So in this case, we&#8217;re taking the exact same principles but just applying it to an offline property, specifically one&#8217;s car, where we know already has a lot of eyeballs and follows where the customer goes.</p>\n<h3>A win-win situation in a bad economy</h3>\n<p>Especially in this economy, people are very stripped of cash and a lot of them would signup since it does not make their lives more inconvenient.</p>\n<p>Gas price is expected to rise again, so a program offering to pay for their gas is a win-win situation because the driver would not be concerned of driving longer distances, while the company would gain more exposure for that.</p>\n<p>If you have 200 of these cars driving around, with lets say about $200 per car per month. That&#8217;s $40,000 a month, which is the price of many billboards.</p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s convincing that each of these cars will be seen by AT LEAST 20 different people a day(I would say over 100 if the driver spends more than an hour a day commuting), so the total reach would become 20x30x200 = 120,000 per month. What&#8217;s even better is that these ads are guaranteed to be at where a lot of people are, since it&#8217;s the people themselves that are taking them there.</p>\n<h3>Potentials of getting some free press and word-of-mouth marketing</h3>\n<p>If your company is one of the first to do something like this, people will start to talk about you if they see the same promotion on 3-4 different cars while driving to work. The press might even cover you so there&#8217;s a lot of added benefits, making it even more cost effective.</p>\n<p>Even the 200 people who wear your ads will excitingly talk to their friends and their coworkers about it, creating WAY stronger effects than just a billboard ad.</p>\n<p>Also, what better way to make people&#8217;s day better than having them be cheerfully reminded of this everyday in the morning?</p>\n<p>If you know you are making money off just driving, it makes you feel better about commuting, or even when you are stuck in traffic. (Note: for environmental concerns, please still commute when you can. I am referring to people that are already driving that distance no matter what.)</p>\n<h3>Make it easy for people to opt out and rely on honor codes</h3>\n<p>In terms of practicality concerns, it would probably be difficult have people&#8217;s cars painted, because they need something that they can be easily opt out from.</p>\n<p>However, creating some sort of easily removed stickers and have a few on each side of the car should have the same effects with very low set up costs.</p>\n<p>Sure, there might be some dishonest people who turn in the gas receipts of their spouses car too etc etc, but even if that is the case, the price of having these mobile ads is still excellent. Obviously it shouldn&#8217;t go way out of hand, but that&#8217;s easy to detect.</p>\n<p>You could probably include in the contract that once someone is caught cheating, they need to return all the gas money that was every given to them because there is no way to verify how much did they cheat on. Fear of that and losing this good deal would probably stop most people from cheating.</p>\n<p>The point is that you are getting a crazy promotion deal with a fraction of what it would cost you otherwise, and it makes the driver happy too.</p>\n<p>If you refer back to my blogpost <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/entrepreneurship/impress-driving/\">How to Impress Everyone by Just Driving Around</a>, driving becomes ultra productive. You increase your level by learning from podcasts, and you get paid doing it!</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Pre-judgements are often made based on age</strong></p>\n<p>A few days ago I had a good voice chat with my good friend and internet personality Jamie Varon. We talked about her goals of breaking through social boundaries and setting people free from surrounding expectations.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the conversation, we started talking about young social media marketers. Being completely appropriate on topic, she asked me, &#8220;and how old are you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when my mind suddenly made a little pause.</p>\n<p>I usually feel a little reserved when people ask about my age, particularly because I know that people inevitably make some judgements based on age. And up till now, my age does not put me in the good side of this judgement.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a pretty open person, so while my mind had a pause, I promptly answered: &#8220;I&#8217;m twenty-two. I&#8217;ll actually become twenty-three on Saturday.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jamie&#8217;s response was not surprising: &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re only twenty-two? I thought you were much older than me, at least twenty-six! I actually find that fascinating!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I was already pretty much used to that response. But while Jamie finds it fascinating that I am only twenty-two, most people don&#8217;t.</p>\n<h3>Is being young a valid disqualifier for what you want to do?</h3>\n<p>I remember last year at the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Web 2.0 Expo\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2009\">Web 2.0 Expo</a>, my co-founder <a href=\"http://junloayza.com\">Jun Loayza</a> had a chat with an older professional. When Jun revealed he was twenty two during that time, the professional pretty much called him stupid and said, &#8220;You should NEVER tell people you are twenty-two!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I guess you lose all credibility once people know you are that young.</p>\n<p>From my own background, I have always been working with people much older than me. My teammates are usually older, people I manage are often-times older, and my clients are usually twice or even thrice my age.</p>\n<p>It is very interesting, but I sometimes really wonder how many of the opportunities I had in the past would still be there if everyone knew my age at the beginning. I have had the opportunities to be the advisor for a few different organizations and startups, the opportunity to do keynote/speeches at firms university conferences, as well as become mentors to people with advanced degrees.</p>\n<p>Would that all be gone if I wore my age on my forehead? Would being young disqualify me from creating value for people around me with skill sets that I have? Depending on what generation you are from, some would say yes, and some would say no.</p>\n<h3>The Gen-Y Mentality</h3>\n<p>It is no secret that the Gen-Ys are perceived as kids who are disloyal to employers, expect too much from others, and think highly of themselves. It is known that the Gen-Ys feel that they can already run complicated projects in a firm and resist against grunt work.</p>\n<p>In a previous post about <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/philosophy/why-are-gen-ys-less-loyal-to-their-employers/\" target=\"_blank\">Why are Gen-Ys less loyal to their employers</a>, I suggested that the Gen-Ys expect more because of the instant flow of information and an understanding that corporate America is not loyal to them.</p>\n<p>I actually do believe that the Gen-Y is more ambitious and more knowledgeable compared to all other generations during the same age period.</p>\n<p>In the older days, when someone is curious about something, they have to go to the library, look through the index cards, find the book, and find the pages the information is at. Most people give up their curiosity if they can&#8217;t find an experienced person around them.</p>\n<p>But nowadays because of the internet, our generation grew up with all the information at our finger tips. You can find out about anything you want in a few seconds. You can even ask and answer anyone you want about it online. The answer no longer lies solely in the older person who has been in the field for years.</p>\n<p>Gen-Ys definitely grew up in a setting where knowledge and information flows through them faster than any other generation. It is also because of this instant information tendency, that the Gen-Y feels that they should be given all the information and be able to input their own opinion in companies. This also makes the Gen-Ys very impatient towards moving up the corporate ladder.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the Gen-Ys are more ambitious due to the cultural installment of the entertainment industry. Because of epics and fantasy media, the Gen-Y grew up imagining themselves being the stars in the movies and cartoons. They inherently believe that they are the main characters in this world, and the environment is there for them to overcome.</p>\n<p>This tendency is even stronger with games. Earlier kids could just watch heros and wish they were like these heros. However, due to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Video Games\" rel=\"wikinvest\" href=\"http://www.wikinvest.com/industry/Video_Games\">video games</a>, the Gen-Y grew up in complete control of these heros and strove to beat challenge after challenge. This idea of them being in control of their lives to overcome difficult quests again creates an expectation of doing great things early on in life.</p>\n<h3>Corporate America: Paying your dues</h3>\n<p>What should you do when you graduate from college? DUH! You should get a &#8220;real job&#8221;, start from the bottom up, and do your grunt work, also known as paying your dues. You might get some experience watching how your managers take care of business and one day you can be promoted!</p>\n<p>Many Gen-Ys resist this idea, but it&#8217;s actually very reasonable why they need to do all the grunt work when they first enter a large corporation.</p>\n<p>After all, SOMEONE has to do the tedious work right? Would it make more sense that a manager does it? Would it make sense that a Partner does it?</p>\n<p>Of course not. It makes complete sense that the younger employees who are new in the company do all the grunt work. And if they have done it for long enough and well enough, they will be given more responsibilities. Heck, they even get PAID a lot to just pay their dues. What&#8217;s there to complain about?</p>\n<p>If your goal is to become a Manager or Partner at a large company, it is necessary for you to do all that work. After all, the Managers have all done this before you. Why should you be the one that jumps over people?</p>\n<p>However, not everyone&#8217;s goal is to become a Partner at a large firm.</p>\n<p>When people dogmatically tell you, &#8220;This is what you must do as a first step,&#8221; they would only be right if they knew where you want to go!</p>\n<p>If your goal is to become a musician, then who can tell you that your first step is to work in an accounting firm?</p>\n<h3>Experience matters. And it matters a lot.</h3>\n<p>One thing that I would like to point out is that I am a firm believer that experience matters. If you have spent more time on something and have been through more battles in that field, what you say would definitely have more credibility than others.</p>\n<p>However, just because a person is older does NOT mean s/he is more experienced in everything. Yes, you should always pay your respect to elders because they have seniority over you. But when it comes down to work and creating value, there are definitely things that you may do better than them.</p>\n<p>Experience is actually based on time spent in a certain field, not how many years you have been in it. Just because a person has been doing something for ten years doesn&#8217;t mean s/he has the most experience.</p>\n<p>If a person slacked around most of the time and only do the minimum work for five years on a subject, he would not have more experience than a person who spends ten committed hours a day trying to get better at it for one year. That is why you see a lot of Masters in Computer Science perform weaker than high school hackers.</p>\n<p>Because of that, even though some people who are older and have been in the corporate world for 15 years, when they want to start a new company, I sincerely believe I still have something valuable to teach them. I have been doing startups for four years now, and for two years I spent over 80 hours a week working in the trenches and learning about entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>In that case, I would never argue with a person how to maneuver through company politics. If they have backgrounds in the field, I would not challenge how their financial spreadsheets are built. I would not challenge what is the best way to set up the technology. They know so much more than I do in these fields and I can only humbly learn from them.</p>\n<p>However, I feel like in many cases, I can guide them in finding the right target market. I can teach them how to motivate a team of non/underpaid teammates towards a common vision. I can show them how to utilize social media to reach the most people with the least amount of spending. I can advise them to avoid feature creep and strip down their product to simplicity.</p>\n<p>If an adult suddenly declared that he wants to become a strong gamer, do you think teen gamers should learn from him because he is older, or should it be the other way around since the teen gamers has more experience?</p>\n<h3>You vs The Future You</h3>\n<p>With the same logic, if I met another entrepreneur who is way more successful than I am, or even one who has been through a lot more battles and failures than I have, I would not feel qualified to advise on running start ups. I would try to learn as much as I can from this person and listen to what s/he says.</p>\n<p>I remember last year I was in a conversation with Jun. He expressed frustration about how, even though we have all the qualities of what &#8220;literature&#8221; says makes a good entrepreneur, people don&#8217;t give us credibility because of how young we were.</p>\n<p>My response was, &#8220;Well, if you had the option of investing in us, or invest in the us ten years from now, which one would you choose?&#8221; The answer is obviously we would invest in the us ten years from now, because whatever we are good at now, we would be much much better (hopefully) ten years from now.</p>\n<p>Now there are probably quite a few entrepreneurs out there who are like us ten years from now (OK, almost as good as \ud83d\ude42 ), and investors obviously favor them over us today.</p>\n<p>In this case, experience matters a lot, but more years of experience only matters if they were all filled with hours of productivity and learning.</p>\n<h3>The Key is to Level up Faster than others</h3>\n<p>So since your ability and credibility is not determined by your age but by your experience measured in hours, you need to make sure you are spending a lot of committed time towards leveling up in your field.</p>\n<p>That is why identifying your life goals and passions is so important. It helps you focus early and level up faster than your peers.</p>\n<p>The earlier you start, and the more hours you spend on something each day, the stronger you will become in that field.</p>\n<p>By then, even though you are younger than everyone around you, as long as you continuous create good value for everyone, you would have established your credibility and gain the respect of others.</p>\n<p>Soon, the next generation of high school kids will think they are more capable at a lot of things than most grown ups, and they will also annoy the heck out of the Gen-Ys. Just like the ocean, each wave covers the one before.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n",

I thought that may come useful to do one of those &#8220;New Year Predictions&#8221; kind of thing. I&#8217;ll admit, some of this is no-duh common sense, but that&#8217;s how a lot of the prediction&#8217;s I&#8217;ve seen are, so bear with me. Hopefully I have some kind of non-obvious insight:</p>\n<p><strong>1. In a recession economy, <a title=\"Green Collar\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_collar_jobs\" target=\"_blank\">Green Collar Jobs</a> will be the expanding field.</strong> I say this because all the resourceful parties are focusing on environmental sustainability, consumers are demanding green products, company employees are demanding their firm become socially responsible. The Government is working hard to use the Green Economy to boost up the other sectors. Venture Capitalists are putting money into Clean Tech, and Universities are putting in loads of research budget into it. When the earth is dying, green is one of those field that is recession free. Afterall, everyone can fulfill their childhood dreams of saving the world.</p>\n<p><strong>2. China will consolidate its economy while India will have a higher market penetration in the offshoring business.</strong> I have heard many experts from China that they are concerned that their economy is growing too fast without people being prepared for it in terms of growth infrastructure and cultural. The global recession will actually help them consolidate their economy and also let them shift their focus from exporting to their own 1.3 Billion consumers. India, on the other hand, is fully geared to become a larger service player to the US. Especially after outsourcing philosophies like &#8220;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Is_Flat\" target=\"_blank\">The World is Flat</a>&#8221; and <a title=\"4 hour\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4-Hour_Workweek\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;The 4-Hour Workweek,&#8221;</a> concepts like outsourcing your life will become predominant as people try to do things in cheaper ways.</p>\n<p><strong>3. <a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> will become mainstream and introduce a non-intrusive monetization method to test the waters with no difficulty.</strong> People who become prominent early on Twitter will get paid for it as consultants. There will be hundreds of Twitter Apps and Tools that are built while Twitter keeps its interface clean, and they might buy a few more of these apps/tools.</p>\n<p><strong>4. <a title=\"VW\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_worlds\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Worlds</a> growth will slow down due to the recession, but will still become more and more dominant. </strong>Companies and Businesses will look further into how they can take advantage of Web3D as the next wave of Web 2.0. Its cheaper, more interactive, more fun, and more efficient.</p>\n<p><!--more--><strong>5. Personal Branding online will become the best way to secure a stable career.</strong> As companies layoff folks, individuals will realize that the only way to make sure that they will have a paycheck is to become the thought leader in their field. If whenever someone thinks of a specific skill set they think of you, you will always be paid for what you know. As a result, more people will blog, vlog, create podcasts, and Twitter.<br />\n<strong><br />\n6. More startups will form as high quality people lose their jobs.</strong> Knowing that other companies aren&#8217;t really hiring, people will become consultants and start software/internet startups due to the low cost it takes to make one these days. Startups will all START with a revenue model, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) will become predominant.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Blizzard will launch a (and only one) top-rated game that wipes out a few more billion productive hours. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>8. </strong>Cheaper but convenient goods like Netbooks and Cloud Computing will sell quite well. People will always need technology, but now they&#8217;re looking at the cheaper alternatives. Amazon, along with the Kindle promoted by Oprah, will actually have an extremely good year with used books, cloud computing, and Kindle. Walmart will also do very well with its discounted pricing. Normal book stores will fall.</p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> Google will finally have some backlash, Microsoft will suffer but will buy some discounted companies (not Yahoo), Apple will remain strong but profits will slow down due to premium pricing, Yahoo will get bought by a large media company, Digg will not be bought, Facebook will become even more powerful with Facebook Connect but will slowly lose fanatics users, eBay will struggle from sales, and Viralogy will become the market leader in personal blogging.</p>\n<p><strong>10. <a title=\"Guy\" href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Guy Kawasaki</a></strong> will establish himself as a successful entrepreneur with <a title=\"Alltop\" href=\"http://alltop.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alltop</a> (after people laughed at him when he started), and finally earn high respect as a successful VC with <a title=\"Simplyhired\" href=\"http://SimplyHired.com\" target=\"_blank\">SimplyHired</a> among other startups, on top of his proven author and speaker reputation.</p>\n",

Apparently a person has more guts when his head is hot. </p>\n<p>After thinking about what is grossly upsetting in society and has a large impact on peoples&#8217; lives, I was reminded about the incompetencies of many university Career Centers that my friends and I have experienced.</p>\n<h3> University Career Centers hate it when others want learn about their performances </h3>\n<p>To start my story, I&#8217;ll begin with the study my company Future Delivery, which helps Gen-Ys find great careers, tried to do on Career Centers earlier 2008. In hopes that Career Centers would work with us and use our free tools to help students more efficiently, we contacted over 50 top university career centers, asking them if we could do a study on how well they help their students and potentially creating a ranking for them. Most of them ignored us, half a dozen of them politely rejected, one school responded with enthusiasm (will praise later), and some responded in a hostile manner.</p>\n<p>While we were still contacting the career centers, we actually got a very upsetting call from the UCLA Career Center(sadly my Alma Mater). Yes, I&#8217;m calling you out UCLA, because I want you to be better. Instead of just demanding me to take this off, please improve your ways first. UCLA told us that they heard about what we are trying to do, and they are very angry. They said they were at a Pac-10 Career Center Conference (didn&#8217;t know those existed) and Future Delivery was brought up. All the schools were very upset about our &#8220;study&#8221; and said they would not let us do this.</p>\n<p>So we told the UCLA Career Center that we just wanted to see how they are helping their students, and also will also talk to university students to see if they feel helped by the career center. We thought the career center might as well talk to us too and so they can promote all the positive things they do. </p>\n<p>UCLA not only refused, they prohibited us from talking to the student body about it, claiming that &#8220;I don&#8217;t think what the students say about the Career Center is an accurate measurement of how we help the students.&#8221; I thought that was pretty ridiculous. What else is a good measurement? How much funding they get a year?</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3> Universities are like subsidized businesses </h3>\n<p>The thing about public schools, is that its like a subsidized business: it can afford to be inefficient. If companies are not doing things efficiently, they die. Public agencies usually have a budget no matter how well they do, and the employees don&#8217;t get rewarded based on their performance. Most schools (including private ones) have extremely inefficient administration services that send you from one window to another. </p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s the best-run division in UCLA? Parking Enforcement. The revenue department is obviously more important than the customer service department. 30 seconds at the wrong spot and there&#8217;s your one way ticket to misery. If the UCLA Parking Enforcement team worked for Future Delivery, I&#8217;m sure the world would already know about  Viralogy  even before we launch.</p>\n<h3> Career Centers try to hinder school organizations that help the student body with career development </h3>\n<p>So that experience also brought back some memories while I co-founded Bruin Consulting at UCLA. During that time, top consulting firms like Mckinsey, Boston Consulting Group, and Booz Allen Hamilton did not really recruit UCLA students because the students were so unprepared in the field of consulting. Our goal was to get these companies back to UCLA, and prepare the students so well that whenever they do come, they are thoroughly impressed by the student body. We were very successful and Bruin Consulting remains one of the premiere business organizations on campus. </p>\n<p>However, while we were helping UCLA students get prepared for Case Interviews and learn about various companies, the UCLA Center approached us and said that we needed to stop doing what we were doing because we were growing too fast. They pretty much said that if companies could do everything so much more efficiently through Bruin Consulting, they would stop sponsoring the Career Center.</p>\n<p>Wait&#8230;.what? I thought the Career Center was there to make sure students get good jobs, and would be happy that we helped them cover a part of the 40,000 student body. OK, fine, if you wanted to monopolize this VERY important service, lets see how you do. Among the 40,000 student body, if I remember correctly, the career center gives out mock interviews to 30 students a quarter. Hmmm, my college education has taught me that this is not a very high ratio. </p>\n<p>What about the resume help? All my peers said they just said your resume is fine even though it was horrible. They let go of 4-page resumes, even though recruiters have specifically said, &#8220;you can put anything you want on your resume, as long as it is one-page long.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Yes, their Bruinview service is actually pretty good, but that&#8217;s because companies respect the UCLA name and constantly list their jobs there themselves.</p>\n<p>So yea, I understand you don&#8217;t have the budget or resources to cover such a large student body. But instead of endorsing student organizations that do your job for you for free, why spend that energy to threaten them? That&#8217;s pretty disgusting to me. </p>\n<h3> Companies dislike working with Career Centers and claim they are non-responsive, while school budget-makers hear great things about the Career Centers.</h3>\n<p>I have a friend who works as a recruiter at a reputable engineering firm, and he told me that he is proposing to cut budgets for various university career centers because they were &#8220;uncooperative, hard to work with and non-responsive.&#8221; I hate to admit, but he said that the USC Career Center was friendly and worked hard to make the connection between the company and motivated students easier and better.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that I have a friend who works for the University of California Regents (like the Board of Directors of all the UC schools), and when I pointed this out to him, he said, &#8220;Hmmm, that&#8217;s interesting, because the UCLA Career Center has won many awards and is known for its programs.&#8221; There clearly lies a misalignment between the high-level decision/budget makers and the end-users who use the service. That&#8217;s why one of the Good to Great CEOs, when newly appointed the job, spent 50% of his time with the end-user, observing how they use the products and the problems they face.</p>\n<h3> Extremely impressed with the Notre Dame Career Center</h3>\n<p>One of the university career centers that I was highly impressed with was Notre Dame. When we contacted them about our study on career centers, they responded with feverish enthusiasm. They told us that we could interview every one of their career counselors, as they are all completely passionate about helping their students. We could examine how they use new tools and technology to make the connections between students and companies easier. Finally, they said they were frustrated how their hard work never affected the university rankings, and would welcome a ranking system for the career centers. Even though we were never able to do the real study because there were so few schools that cooperated, I ended up with the utmost respect for the Notre Dame Career Center. They made me want to be a Notre Dame student.</p>\n<h3> Career Centers should be the first to tackle one of the largest problems in society </h3>\n<p>In FD, we believe that too many young people don&#8217;t know what they want to do, and too many older people hate their jobs. We believe its because people don&#8217;t have enough information and opportunities when they were in college and started off in a career they do not care about. The Career Center is the first to have this great opportunity to solve this enormous problem. Take advantage of it! Even though I mostly wrote about the UCLA Career Center, every person I talked to also revealed similar experiences\u00a0 with their own career centers, so its a universal problem that all career centers need to think about.</p>\n<p>What does everyone else think about your career centers while you were in school? Are they helpful? Do they care about their students? I would love to know if you guys have the same experience, or actually have great career centers that helped you get to where you are today. That way I can recommend them to high-school kids!</p>\n",

There are sites that organize your friends, see your influence on twitter, use twitter on your desktop or phone, take pictures to twitter, see who you should follow, see what clients your friends use for twitter etc etc. Most sites need to cramp out their design while adding features that may or may not work. Twitter just keeps its constraints (the three principles of twitter: <span id=\"articleBody\"><a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/06/twitter_ceo_jac_2.html\" target=\"_blank\">simplicity, constraint, and craftsmanship</a>), and have the rest of the sites build its advanced features. I don&#8217;t think ANY other site out there has something like this.</span></p>\n<p><!--more-->With all this hype, its been a constant issue regarding how Twitter will monetize it, just like all the other sites that looked nice but died later on. Everyone&#8217;s watching how Twitter will make money. A company is not in business if it doesn&#8217;t make money.</p>\n<p>However, I will explain in this post why This Dude is wrong.</p>\n<p>Twitter users are obsessed with Twitter. Their quality of lives will decrease significantly when Twitter dies. There&#8217;s no substitute because there are true bonds on twitter (unless you import all followers to another service). Most important, there are plenty of revenue models that Twitter COULD adapt to if they aren&#8217;t afraid of pissing off the casual users (kinda like laying off your employees&#8230;.laying off your casual customers?)</p>\n<p>Today I was using <a href=\"http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/\" target=\"_blank\">TweetDeck</a> (highly recommended), and after some usage, it told me that my Twitter API Limit has been exceeded. This happened a few times to me in the past week as I start to use Twitter a little bit more often. It turns out that Twitter allows each ACCOUNT 100 API calls per hour. This counts when you import your tweets onto your blog, when you see an updated list of your tweeples, when you look at other tweeples&#8217; profiles etc etc. When you click &#8220;refresh&#8221; on Tweetdeck, it actually takes up 3 calls (DM, Reply, All Tweets). This means as more people use API clients for their various purposes, more people will meet that 100 limit frequently.</p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t think I was using TweetDeck THAT much, but after having it on my blog, tweetdeck, and phone, I needed to sit and wait for another 40 minutes before I could use Twitter through Tweetdeck again! So I hate to point this out since I don&#8217;t want to see it happen, but at this point I believe the best Twitter revenue model is to charge a small fee for premier accounts regarding API Limits. Maybe $2 a month to expand one&#8217;s limit to 150, $5 a month for those who want a limit of 200, and $10 for a no limit account.The benefit of this structure is that you only tailor to the hardcore users. You still allow normal users and new users to get addicted to the site seemlessly. Sooner or later, they will become hardcore users. And trust me, only the very hardcore users who use a lot of &#8220;Twipper Apps&#8221; and services will need it.</p>\n<p>Now going over the 200 limit is impossible you may say. But trust me, its realistic in the future. As people integrate more twitter apps and services seamlessly into their lifestyle, they WILL need a much higher limit. I&#8217;m JUST getting more involved with twitter, and I already struck the limit upon 20 minutes into the hour. I then tried to use <a title=\"twubble\" href=\"http://crazybob.org/twubble/\" target=\"_blank\">Twubble</a>, but it also told me my API Limit was exceeded. Since my twitter flow was interrupted, I kinda just drifted unproductively on the internet before doing anything else. As time goes by, people will need a higher API Limit. Trust me. I wonder if <a title=\"Guy\" href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Guy Kawasaki</a> has felt any APIL annoyance yet. (Btw, &#8220;Apple&#8221; sounds pretty good)</p>\n<p>So yea, I hate to introduce ways that Twitter could charge me, but I would hate it even more if Twitter had to go away like Pownce. Twitter will become an important communication tool in the future. How much do you pay for your phone and texting again?</p>\n",

It talks about how one can outsource her life and business to others so they make the most out of their time. The concept is pretty simple: if you make $30/hr, then instead of doing 4 hours of mundane tasks yourself, you can do one hour of work, make $30, and pay 3 people with $10/hr. That way you did one hour of work, but you accomplished 4 hours of tasks. You now then have the rest of the three hours to do whatever you want (including make more money at your rate).</p>\n<p>Our company is looking at ways to outsource and automate too. We want to do everything, but do everything only once (<a title=\"kiyosaki\" href=\"http://www.richerdaddy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Kiyosaki&#8217;s</a> suggestion). Once we set up a system, we can slowly start to replace ourselves with someone who can learn how to do it. Michael Gerber often refers to this as &#8220;work on the business, not in the business.&#8221; We plan to build a money-making machine, and then automate it so we can develop more innovative stuff.</p>\n<p>My company then decided to look at a few places overseas that offer offshoring services. Whew! Americans are going to be in trouble soon (if people don&#8217;t already think they are in big trouble from the financial crisis). Lets just say this very professional firm that has been operating for nine years with 180 engineers, who also happen to have built dozens of websites of large brand name firms that you have heard of in multiple countries. The keypoint: they charge 20% of what a service firm like this in the US would charge. Go figure.</p>\n<p><!--more-->Outsourcing doesn&#8217;t even just deal with engineering. Many are starting to oursource their personal life too: emails, scheduling meetings, making friends online, pay bills, make vacation reservations, buy stuff online etc etc. Tim Ferris even outsourced dating (well, arranging the dates; he still had to go to the dates himself). Even more exaggerated is that his friend AJ <a title=\"Outsourced Life\" href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/outsourcing-life/\" target=\"_blank\">outsourced conflict resolution with his wife, as well as stressing out!</a> No more worries about life for $5/hr. Not bad at all.</p>\n<p>So what do Americans do about it? Is everyone screwed? Well, many are, but not everyone. The appealing thing about offshore technolgy development is the value/price ratio is extremely high. They would have the skillset of 7, but charge the price of 2. Clearly cost effective. However, there are still many entities that demand the absolute best. They are looking for the 10s, not matter how much it costs. They clearly understand that 1 good engineer is better than 50 bad ones, and the difference between a 9 and a 10 is the difference between failing and a huge success.</p>\n<p>So the solution is simple: 1. be the best at whatever you do. and 2. brand yourself or your company correctly, and 3. network like crazy.</p>\n<p>OK, all these are obvious, and all these are easier said than done. But that&#8217;s the reality: <strong>when there are more people competing in your space, you need to do the things that make you more competitive.</strong> Guess how much complaining helps? ?. It doesn&#8217;t even matter if your competition is from another country or not. When there are more skilled workers in the same space, you need to work harder and reach more people to stay in the field. That goes with any kind of shrinking market. If the economy is doing badly and unemployment reaches 15% (lets hope never), that doesn&#8217;t mean you are screwed. It simply means that you need to work your butt off and make sure you are part of the top 85% who does have a job.</p>\n<p>Luckily, this force to be reckoned with at this point is mostly competing in the low-end market. The quality of the work is often problematic. The reliability is sometimes doubtful. Miscommunications happen often. The language barriers might get in the way. Timezone issues can be annoying. The skill levels might not reach what is required. All this means that as long as you are competing in the high-end market, you will be less affected. Some offshore firms have been doing a four-sigma (not six yet. Any Indian entrepreneur?) thing in making sure communication, reliability and skill sets requirements are held to a certain standard. That&#8217;s scary. But as long as you do great work and brand yourself in the higher end, there WILL be ample opportunities for you. Sometimes it just comes down to sales. A cheap Indian firm that I have no idea about vs a company that seems to gaurantee results and profits. You at least have chance.</p>\n<p>In short: constantly increase your skills, brand yourself in the high-end, build interpersonable relationships with clients, and constantly strive to become more competitive. For those of you who don&#8217;t want to work hard, learn new things, be friendly to customers, sell yourself well, and all in all become a great engineer, you might be screwed. That&#8217;s how the world evolves: survival for the ones that can do more with less.</p>\n",

A company would put in so much effort, energy and money just to recruit this tech-savvy generation, but sees the hard work become futile as it fails to retain them for more than two years. What&#8217;s wrong with this generation? Why can&#8217;t companies with billions worth of revenue satisfy their needs? Here are my 4 reasons why Gen-Ys are less loyal to their employers than previous generations:</p>\n<h3>1. The Gen-Ys have observed that corporations are not loyal to them either.</h3>\n<p>Companies stress employee loyalty, but the Gen-Ys have their eyes open on how the companies will do anything to make more profits. IT World says it well when they stated &#8220;Generation Y saw first-hand what their Baby Boomer and older Gen X parents got for their loyalty to their employers during economic downturns: bupkus. They saw their parents get laid off. They saw their parents&#8217; pensions disappear. They saw their parents get meager severance packages.&#8221; When a company does everything it cans to make already-richer people richer, the Gen-Ys feel no pain in finding something that pay their bills better.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>2. The Gen-Ys feel that they are not put into the environment that uses their best skills for the best reasons.</h3>\n<p>I always say people work for two reasons: one for money, and two for making life meaningful. Making one&#8217;s life more meaningful involves using her best skills for purposes she believes in. When Gen-Ys enter large corporations as &#8220;analysts&#8221; and &#8220;associates,&#8221; they are pinned down to do all the grunt work all day, what we know as &#8220;paying their dues.&#8221; Even though it is completely understandable that someone in the company has to do the grunt work, and obviously it should be those young ones that just joined the company recently, the Gen-Ys don&#8217;t think its the best use of their most vibrant years.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll say it straight-forwardly: Gen-Ys are smarter than Gen-Xs and Boomers, comparing the average person at the same age. No, they&#8217;re not born smarter, but think about how much information goes through their brain everyday. In the old days, if you were curious about something, you had to go to the library (maybe without a car), look through the indexes, find the right book, and find the right page. Most people would give up on that curiosity. But the Gen-Ys are used to just making a few clicks and reading everything there is about the subject on the internet since they were in Kindergarten. They have more problem-solving games than Gen-X and Boomers, who are more acquainted to outdoor physical activities, and they can spread their knowledge to other Gen-Ys way more efficiently than the older generations ever could. When the boomers were in high school, how many of them could hack into government properties or start a IT consulting business? It is for this reason, Gen-Ys are often very capable of doing very complex and technically advanced things and they expect to do more than they are given.</p>\n<h3>3. The Gen-Ys are acquainted to dream bigger.</h3>\n<p>Gen-Ys grew up with a lot more media, including video games, movies, and successes of legendary men. They are constantly immersed in a virtual environment where they play a hero and conquer great quests. They often see superheros save the world. All the literature and successes they learned about has made them big dreamers: they can do great things in life, even save the world! This is why Gen-Ys are so involved about Sustainability and Socially Responsible entities. The motto goes, &#8220;We are the ones we&#8217;ve been waiting for.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>4. The Gen-Ys have more information and opportunities.</h3>\n<p>Because of their uses of the internet, Social Media and the likes, Gen-Ys have way more opportunities (hence choices) than other generations. Sites like Monster, Vault and FD Career all help them find new jobs and careers. In addition, the adaptation of blogging (best way to build your personal brand), twittering, and utilizing social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn has created ample chances of recruiters &#8220;poking&#8221; them or &#8220;tweeting&#8221; them about a new position. When you get 3-4 offers a week trying to outmatch your stingy boss who look down upon you, who wouldn&#8217;t reconsider?</p>\n<p>So what can you do as an employer? The key is to treat them like grownups instead of children. Yes, they might lack 10 years of experience compared to you. But if you learned how to use the pistol for 10 years, you still shouldn&#8217;t just make a new guy who knows how to use the machine gun shine your shoes. If you respect their advice and give them a bit of high level work every once in awhile, Gen-Ys are OK with doing grunt work, AS LONG as they see how this grunt work contributes to the big picture. Gen-Ys hate being in the dark with no questions asked.</p>\n<p>You should make sure that the Gen-Ys feel like teammates instead of slaves, and that you are offering a platform to dream big. Offer your company up as the best way to fulfill their dreams. Have them combine their dreams with the goal of the company. If you are able to convince them that you are loyal to them and respect their dreams and abilities, Gen-Ys are more than happy to make your company the greatest in the world. Afterall, they&#8217;ve been waiting for that opportunity for a decade growing up.</p>\n",

I claimed that its the culture and value systems that make the difference, not the actual race. Growing up in South Africa, Taiwan, Kansas and California, I would know something about cultural differences. Also, I am FULLY convinced that racial differences and stereotypes are a big part of our society, and the solution is not to taboo everyone that mentions such, but to speak about it in a civilized manner with the purpose of finding a solution in being open-minded, mutually tolerant and respected.</p>\n<p>With that said (especially to get me out of trouble a little), this blogpost gathered tons of traffic from people searching on Google. You can see what people are searching for and trying to understand. A common theme you can see are: parents, study, math, school. This is partially funny, but partially horrible. Some of them are obviously asian kids trying to feel good about themselves, others are other ethnicities figuring out why their classmates have no life. It even goes as ridiculous as one person searching &#8220;is there anything wrong with a white kid liking an asian kid.&#8221; Duh! Of course its not wrong! (as long as you like the person for the right reason \ud83d\ude09 )</p>\n<p>Anyway, I thought it would be interesting to show this phenomenon to people, one for a good laugh, and two to see how people are privately exploring the racial topics when its so publicly taboo.

Most people have no clue where to start, what questions to ask, how to structure things, and how to tackle the problems. Even when you have studied those frameworks, the 3C, 5C, 7S, Porter&#8217;s Five Forces, you still don&#8217;t really know what to do once you lay out the structure.</p>\n<p>I found out that doing a small adoption of my Gamification Framework Octalysis, I created this business analysis system for high-growth companies, and I have found that it can be adapted to implement better analysis. The tool is called Octalysis for Business Strategy. It is an analysis system that divides a business into eight sectors: Finance, Customer/Client, Human Capital, Market, Competition, Resources, Technology and Operations.</p>\n<p>1. Finance is pretty straight forward: profits, cash flow, pricing and the bunch.<br />\n2. Customer/Client is everything that deals with the customer, ranging from Marketing, Lead Generation, Lead Conversion, and Client Fulfillment.<br />\n3. Operations is everything behind the scenes, including logistics, manufacturing, and distribution.<br />\n4. Human Capital is everything dealing with the people, including the usual hiring and firing, compensation, management team, but also things like management strategy and culture.<br />\n5. Technology is divided into two fields: the technology of the product, and the IT systems of the company.<br />\n6. Market deals with issues like the economy, supply and demand, political stability etc.<br />\n7. Resources are the intangibles of the business: partnerships, intellectual properties, reputation and such.<br />\n8. Competition is what the competitors are doing and how to respond.</p>\n<p><!--more-->The key to Octalysis for Business Strategy is to analyze the branches separately, derive the strength and weaknesses onto the octagon, and visually see which part of the company should we work on. For instance, take VShirts, a fictional t-shirt company. After analyzing all the separate sectors, one can plot out the level of each sector on the octagon with a dot extending out from each sector. The 90-degree corners where two legs meet (trace the dotted lines) would be considered normal performance. If it is plotted under the dotted-line intersections, then the company is performing poorly on that sector; if it is plotted over the dotted-line intersections, then the company is performing strongly.</p>\n<p>After we have plotted out all eight sectors, we connect the dots and see the company &#8220;shape&#8221; based on how strong they are at each sector. If the shape cuts into the original octagon, that means there are very weak points side-by-side, and it raises a red flag for improvement. For presentation sake, we can then add the strong and weak points onto each sector. Here is an Octalysis example of the company (click to see text clearly).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/octalysis-future-delivery0141.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-143\" title=\"octalysis-future-delivery0141\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/jsutshair.online/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/octalysis-future-delivery0141.jpg?resize=474%2C354&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"474\" height=\"354\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Note that the top sectors are the Active Sectors, as in you are able to change these things within a business. You can change your pricing, your marketing strategy, your operations, etc. The sectors on the bottom are the Passive Sectors, since the company cannot really change them. A company cannot change much of the market, their competitors, and can only change its intangible resources very slowly.</p>\n<p>The sectors on the right are External Sectors: things dealing with the customer, the employees, the market, whereas the sectors on the left are Internal Sectors: things that deal with the operations, the technology, and the resources of a company. Understanding the nature of the sectors yields a great amount of information regarding a company. If a company is strong in the Passive Sectors &#8211; things they cannot change &#8211; but weak in the Active Sectors, this means that the industry and market is good, but the company is operating well and needs to improve. However, if the Passive Sectors are extremely weak, this means that factors that the company cannot change are doing poorly, and the company probably should not even be in that industry!</p>\n<p>Similarly, if a company is strong in the External Sectors but weak on the Internal Sectors, that means the company is great with the people side of things -the customers, the employees, and the market- but weak on the operations, technology and systems aspect of the business. This is when they should consider upgrading their infrastructure, systems, or invite outside consultants to improve their operations. On the other hand, if a company is strong in the Internal Sectors but weak on the External ones, the company is probably filled with bright engineers, lots of money on infrastructure, great business systems, but lack the human touch of selling to customers with great service, creating a empowering culture where everyone wants to do the work, and too product-focused instead of market-focused.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that in case interviews for consulting firms, do NOT use the whole Octalysis structure as your framework. There are too many sectors to be covered in a 30 min interview, and the interviewer will be looking for very specific things. Rather, use Octalysis for Business Strategy as a guideline to derive your own framework. Use it to ask the right questions, jot down notes, and organize your thoughts. When you have finally laid down the framework and structure, it should just be the 3-5 essential factors of the case.</p>\n<p>Now that you know the basic structure of Octalysis for Business Strategy, you are already ready to tackle some free thinking business cases. In later guides, I will go over the second and some third layers of Octalysis for Business Strategy, primarily digging into the eight sectors, benchmarking the strength and weaknesses, and utilizing a numeric rating system to help hone in on the sectors that a company should focus on. I hope you tremendous luck and ability in leveling up and growing in the path of the businessperson!</p>\n",

I was a hardcore <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_ii\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Diablo II</a> player back then, and I would spend a significant amount of time figuring out how would I build my character, assign the right skill points, assemble a team, and conquer difficult quests. I was <a title=\"How to master almost everything\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/lifestyle-gamification/master/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quite good at the game</a> and I helped a lot of my friends plan out their character skill charts and level up according to it.</p>\n<p>Then came the time when my friends started quitting and moved on to another game. I quit too. During this time, I was in that transition phase between quitting a game and moving on to the next one, and I suddenly felt extremely empty.</p>\n<p>I realized that I had I spent thousands upon thousands of hours getting more experience, leveling up, accumulating more gold, collecting better gear. And now I have nothing. My account will be deleted after 3 months of inactivity. It seemed like a big part of my life simply disappeared. What now?</p>\n<h3>Lifestyle Gamification: Pursuing a game that will last and be meaningful</h3>\n<p>So I started to think, what kind of game can I play that tons of people are playing, and they can\u2019t just quit when the next big thing comes out? The conclusion I reached was: it\u2019s pretty much the game of life.</p>\n<p>So, if I were my own <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_(video_games)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RPG</a> character, I wouldn\u2019t stay in town all day, be idle, and walk back and forth, back and forth. NO!! I would go out and kill monsters, get more experience, level up, and conquer cool quests of course.</p>\n<p>I then realized that everyone is playing this game, but not everyone realizes it, especially when they are in high school or college. I figured that, if people are still in town just being idle, (watching TV, partying, not doing much with life) <a title=\"Lazy Man Starts Early\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/lifestyle-gamification/lazy-mans-way-becoming-successful/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I can gain an edge</a> by being out there getting more experience, meeting high level characters, assigning important skill points, and leveling up. Then one day they will realize (out of college) that they are playing this game too, and they will need experience to level up and overcome whatever quest they feel they should conquer with their lives. By then, I would be at level 20 or so with a strong head start.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, my goal is to be the strongest player on my server.</p>\n<h3>Helping people level up and ally with them is the best way to conquer complex quests in this real world</h3>\n<p>In most <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmorpgs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MMORPGs</a>, high level players can help lower level players level up faster. That\u2019s what I have committed my life to do too: get people to realize they are playing this game and help them level up as fast as possible, so that we can help each other out in life(in Lifestyle Gamification, I call this <a title=\"Vertical Networking\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/lifestyle-gamification/vertical-networkingpit-analogy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vertical Networking</a>).</p>\n<p>So I want to be the strongest in my field, and team up with all the strongest in other fields. Together we can complete cool quests to solve problems that the real world faces. In a game, the quest could be killing a monster or building a large empire. In the real world, a quest could be solving global warming, making a better search engine, or running a successful non-profit. The beautiful thing about this particular game is, when you play it, it can be just as thrilling, and it actually makes a difference in this world. You would have made a positive impact in peoples&#8217; lives, and you would be wealthy and reputable if you play it well. Sounds like a good deal.</p>\n<h3>What money can&#8217;t get you, the Lifestyle Gamification can</h3>\n<p>In Lifestyle Gamification, we also call people who just want stability and comfortable lives <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NPCs</a>. NPCs become the environment instead of living passionately. They live everyday to support their existence and buy cool stuff on the side. They slave for 5 days a week so they can do what they want on the weekends. If you think about it, this doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>\n<p>Why do you make money? You make money to increase the quality of life. But you spend so many hours in your life working anyway, that IS your quality of life. It makes little sense for people to pay a lot of money for you to be miserable your entire life. It makes a lot more sense to get paid a bit less, but have your whole life do what you are passionate about and play throughout.</p>\n<h3>I welcome you to join Lifestyle Gamification</h3>\n<p>So this is what I do. I work over 90 hours a week. I also play over 90 hours a week. People I have Lifestyle Gamified also spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to become a stronger player while accomplishing amazing things for their age. Because I feel like I have a better life than most people without necessarily being better in person, I want to bring the philosophy of combining work and play to people, whether through myself, my company culture, or the services/products that it provides.</p>\n<p>I want people to have fun while working by doing what they are passionate about. I want those who are extreme in what they do (like hardcore gamers) to be extreme in what truly matters in this world. So for those who want to play their entire lives and become successful on the way, I welcome you to join Lifestyle Gamification. Lets ally up.</p>\n<p>(To learn how to start the FD Lifestyle, go here: <a title=\"How to Start the Lifestyle Gamification\" href=\"https://jsutshair.online/lifestyle-gamification/how-to-start-the-fd-lifestyle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 4 Steps to Master Lifestyle Gamification\u00a0</a>)</p>\n",

But why did it happen? What does it mean to us as a country? Before anything, lets have a quick summary of what&#8217;s going on (I keep it updated as the days go by):</p>\n<p>In a very short amount of time <a href=\"http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/04/16/jp-morgans-really-weird-capital-raise\" target=\"_blank\">JP Morgan</a> took over <a href=\"http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/28/a-new-genre-on-wall-st-bailout-blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Bear Stearns</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_mae\">Fannie Mae</a><a href=\"http://www.blogtoplist.com/rss/freddie-mac.html\">/</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Home_Loan_Mortgage_Corporation\">Freddie Mac</a> were nationalized, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2008/09/12/black-holes-of-value-at-lehman-brothers/\" target=\"_blank\">Lehman Brothers</a> filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch, and both <a href=\"http://blogmaverick.com/2008/09/16/the-aig-lehman-merrill-lynch-link/\" target=\"_blank\">AIG</a> and <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/sep2008/db20080917_274786.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily\">WaMu</a> are in serious trouble. The Government is now putting in $85 Billion to own 79.9% of AIG, in hopes to make an eventual liquidation event less dramatic. JP Morgan is looking to buy out WaMu too. Out of the big 5 investment broker-dealers, only <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/09/18/16059/morgan-stanleys-talking-to-cic-not-citic/?source=rss\">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dividend.com/blog/?p=1436\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs</a> are relatively out of the mess, but still have reported huge losses this year.</p>\n<p>Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy would be the largest failure of an investment bank since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_Burnham_Lambert\">Drexel Burnham Lambert</a> collapsed amid fraud allegations 18 years earlier. AIG has $1.1 trillion in assets and 74 million clients in 130 countries. If it falls apart, the world will definitely fall into some financial chaos (come <a href=\"http://www.wisebread.com/an-important-financial-lesson-from-fight-club\">Fight Club?</a>).</p>\n<p>So why is this happening? It&#8217;s primarily because of the nature of our economy. The United States economy is run on two things: Credit and Confidence. People lend money, live above their means, and look to pay it all back with their next 30 years of steady income. That&#8217;s why credit card companies are making big bucks here in the US, but less so in other nations. Also, the value of certain entities is not based on how much value it can PRODUCE, but more on how much value it is TO OTHERS. That instantly creates a &#8220;virtual economy&#8221; : something that works because everyone imagines it to work. In essence, money is a virtual good too. It is only worth something because everyone agrees that it does. A farm is a real good, and it produces real value that keeps people alive. However, people start to agree that a virtual good is worth many times that farm, and as long as you can convince the next person that this virtual good is EVEN more times that farm, you are fine. That&#8217;s why when people lose confidence in their currency, hyperinflation like what happened to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic\">Germany</a> takes over, and the virtual goods on peoples&#8217; hands become 1/10 of what they were worth yesterday, and everyone comes back to recognize the value of the farm. Unfortunately, it is not the farm owners who become millionaires, but the virtual goods people who go broke.</p>\n<p>So how does this Credit &#8211; Confidence model lead to what is happening today? Early on, during the real estate inflation, Confidence was high, and a lot of bad loans (Credit) were thrown out there. Later on, people couldn&#8217;t pay up with their mortgage loans, and the <a href=\"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/03/subprime-mortgage-blues.html\">Subprime Mortgage</a> happened. This is the part where Credit goes bad. The economy tanked, and mortgage companies like Countrywide lost a lot of money. Confidence at this point is not looking stellar.</p>\n<p>During this time of Credit gone bad, the 30x leverage that Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers had (for every $1 of asset, they had $30 of debt) wasn&#8217;t helping either. Bear Stearns fell apart when Confidence broke and all the entities were trying to withdraw money from it, causing it to be bought by JP Morgan. Lehman continued to suffer from heavy losses based on the bad Credit with the &#8220;Subprimates.&#8221; It was only holding on by Confidence too. Late August (and this is of course 2008), state-controlled Korea Development Bank engaged in talks about buying 25% of Lehman for $6B. However, it was reported that the Korean bank was &#8220;facing difficulties pleasing regulators and attracting partners for the deal,&#8221; and they withdrew from it. At this point, Lehman lost its last currency of Confidence, and while debtors wanted to pull money out, Lehman became insolvent and had to finally declare bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Now the Confidence factor is very tricky. It is like the <a href=\"http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/09/07/the-frannie-bailout-and-the-prisoners-dilemma\" target=\"_blank\">prisoners dilemma</a> in game theory. If everyone felt confident about the situation and kept their money where it is, then things will go fine. However, whoever withdraws their money will be safe themselves and screw over the rest of the people. In order not to get screwed over, everyone becomes the first to withdraw their money, and the system falls apart. This then becomes a situation where fear of a disaster is also the cause of that disaster, quite a self-fulfilling tragedy.</p>\n<p>Does a nation have to live by the Credit-Confidence Model and go through this? Not necessarily. However, basing your economy on credit and confidence does make it grow a lot faster during boom (high confidence) times, just like wealth can grow faster if you borrow money to buy a house, and the guy down the street thinks its worth more than what you bought it for. The other side of the flip coin is that it also falls a lot harder when everyone is chasing after the same virtual good with relatively little end value. It is more of a choice based on cultural values. In Asian countries, most people live on the cash they have at hand, save a lot, and mostly start businesses that can be run by retained earnings or profits from previous businesses. In the US, more people rely their standard of living on credit cards and mortgages. The US lives on a <a href=\"http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/\" target=\"_blank\">huge international deficit</a>, claiming that all is fine as long as it is somewhat relative to the GDP of THAT time. The US is set in a model that is bound to rotate between explosion and depression.</p>\n<p>What does this mean for us? In a plane economics model, we should cut down on credit and increase inconfidence? If we all felt safe and do business as usual, things might work out. However, that&#8217;s not going to happen. We are all doomed into the &#8220;citizens dilemma&#8221; of trying to protect our own rights before thinking about the common good, particularly when you are sure that the other guy would do the same thing. When everyone stands up in the stadium in hopes to have a better view of the game, no one can see again. It will only take awhile before the brave optimists start to regain that confidence, somewhat of an &#8220;early adapter,&#8221;\u00a0 and have that confidence spread across the nation again. That&#8217;s when you see the explosion in economy and a new hand of billionaires again.</p>\n<p>As for now, you should definitely think about saving (maybe not in US dollars), consume less, and go on sites that get you a job.</p>\n",

It has been quite a rough one. 2 months ago I agreed to live with a friend in Oakland, and I left some of my stuff there. I told him I will go early September.</p>\n<p>Then comes September 5th. Before that my friend was in Taiwan, so I couldn&#8217;t really get in touch with him. He told me September 5th he would come back. It all works out. I packed everything I own in the United States onto my car, and I called him to let him know that I will be there the next day. Oops, it turns out that he is shutting the place down, moving his operations elsewhere, and he forgot to tell me. At that point I have already moved out of my apartment, but had no where to move to. My friend is a cool guy, and is extremely apologetic. However, my life became complicated.</p>\n<p>After living at various friends&#8217; places in Socal, I started my drive up. I passed by my friend&#8217;s 600 acre ranch, and spent 2 days there. I met a lot of great friends from the <a href=\"http://sustainabilitycoalition.org\">California Student Sustainability Coalition</a> and connected with some awesome old friends like Michael Cox, Crystal Durham and Nancy Brown. During this time, I still had no idea where would I move to.</p>\n<p>Finally, when I got here, my Aunt&#8217;s friend knows someone who is looking for a person to occupy a room in her home.

There are a pair of elder couples, a woman, and a college girl living in this house too, and they all seem extremely friendly. The place is 30 min away from Palo Altos (Silicon Valley and Stanford), an hour away from Oakland, and 90 min away from San Francisco. Not bad at all! Most of all, this is 10 minutes away from Eagle&#8217;s uncle&#8217;s house. Eagle is our developer from Canada, and he is moving to the Bay Area with me. Being so close to his Uncle, he could probably live with his Uncle and save a lot of costs. I pay $600 a month, which I seem to be able to afford for at least a few months. Everything seems to be working out. Now I just need to figure out what is around, and learn how to use the BART system.</p>\n<p>Why did I move to the Bay Area? Because <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley\" target=\"_blank\">Silicon Valley</a> is the High-Tech Startup Hub. If you want to do finance, you should go to New York. If you want to be a movie star, there is no reason to stay in Arizona. You should go to Hollywood. Similarly, if you are building a high-tech startup, you should go to Silicon Valley. All the infrastructure, support system, talents and money are here. You find others who moved away from their hometown to persue the same dream that you have. I can&#8217;t explain what it is, but the 3-4 times I came to Norcal, it really felt like home. The weather seems nice, the sky seems more blue, people are supportive and high quality at the same time&#8230;it just seemed like where I belonged. A well respected SEO guy <a href=\"http://www.seanpercival.com/\">Sean Percival</a> told my CMO <a href=\"http://junloayza.com\">Jun</a> that there is also a central startup hub emerging in the area between West Hollywood and Santa Monica, and even though it is second to Silicon Valley, if you start making a name there now, later you can be easily recognized as a big name due to low competiton. With that in mind, I would still like to be up here and seek more opportunities, meet great people, and hopefully create good value to everyone who I interface with in my life.</p>\n<p>Anyone, if you are around or know good people I should meet.

Every single logistical detail went harmoniously wrong, including wasting over 5 hours of accumulated driving time, breaking my iPhone, and having public toilet water splash all over my face. The only saving points were two people that have not disappointed me in my life (semi-rare if I worked with them for awhile): Peter Suberlak and Michael Cox. Other people who have not disappointed me yet are my CMO <a href=\"http://junloayza.com\">Jun Loayza</a>, and my super developer Stephen Johnson.</p>\n<p>Anyway, for some context: I was planning to go up to Oakland from Los Angeles (7 hours drive) to get an interview with <a href=\"http://greenforall.org\">Green For All</a>, an awesome awesome organization focused on environmental sustainability and how it helps produce green-jobs to disadvantaged famillies. I planned to stay up north for 2 weeks, so I can get into the environment and potentially meet people to help out with various things. I planned to go up Thursday. The arrangement was I would live at my friend&#8217;s Dave&#8217;s apartment (he is in Taiwan), but I had to first go to a place 50min away to find his keys in a secret spot. The apartment would be 10-15 minutes away from my interviewing spot, which would be perfect since it&#8217;s scheduled early at 9:30am.</p>\n<p>So usually, for trips like these, you would want to leave early in the day. However, I needed to give my keys to my girlfriend to take care of the apartment, as well as take her to class from work, I decided to wait for 2pm, no problem. I had work to do anyway. When I took my girlfriend to the Getty Center (class), we realized we were 45 minute early, so we decided to get some food. We decided to drive one direction and find spontaneous food on the way. However, after driving 15 minutes north we did not find a single restaurant, and realized we didn&#8217;t have time to eat and come back. So we drove back without eating, and that was an unhappy 30 minutes of wasted driving. Afterwards, I drove for another 20 min, when my girlfriend Amy called again. That&#8217;s when I realized I forgot to give her the keys for my apartment. There you go, another 20 min back, and 20 min up, which adds up to another 60 minutes of wasted time.</p>\n<p>The trip up is decent. Just very tiring. For the entire 7 hours, I was listening to business podcasts or talking on the phone. It&#8217;s somewhat like a 6 hour lecture with the podcasts. Made one 5-minute stop for Subway, and that&#8217;s about it. When I arrived at the secret spot, I was completely exhausted. It was 9 PM and I needed to make my Skype meeting at 10PM. I looked around and could only find a garage opener, but not the keys to Dave&#8217;s apartment. It was very dark but I kept on searching through spiderwebs and such, hoping to find that key. Didn&#8217;t happen. Now I will surely miss the meeting and need to find a place to stay late at night in a foreign city. I have a lot of friends in Norcal, but not that many who I can just crash at without notice, who also is within 30 minutes away.</p>\n<p>This is when Peter Suberlak, somewhat of my mentee who helps a lot in Future Delivery, called to check up. Once he knew where I was, he suprisingly said, &#8220;Hey! I live 15 minutes from where you are at! Need me to go help you?&#8221; That worked out, I chilled at his place. I also realized that I forgot to bring my dress shoes, and he was very happy to borrow me his. A savior of the day. I was slightly late for my meeting, and could barely speak intelligently. This was when I realized my limits: I can&#8217;t really function well as a human being after 7 hours of straight driving while listening to business podcasts. After the meeting, I went straight to bed. Instead of being 15 minutes away from Dave&#8217;s apartment now, I was an hour away, so I needed to wake up earlier in the morning.</p>\n<p>The next day I got to the interview 5 minutes late, mostly due to unfamiliarity with the parking in Oakland and complicated one-way streets. The interview went great, and I made a good connetion with Green For All. Since I was close, I thought I might as well use the garage opener to get into Dave&#8217;s apartment&#8217;s building and use his wifi to get in touch with him. That&#8217;s when I realized that didn&#8217;t work either. After I found a wifi connection somewhere else, I found Dave online and told him that I couldn&#8217;t find the key. He was in shock, and after some investigation he realized that someone changed the arrangement. The garage remote I had was for another house close to where I found it, and I was supposed to use that to open the garage door, go into the house, and get the keys. So due to that, I drove another 50 minutes to that place, got the keys, and another 50 minutes back (extra 30 minutes to drop off shoes to Peter). I got into the apartment and everything is happy. I could stay there for 2 weeks comfortably while doing some good work.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I talked to my Legal Representitive talked to me about my sponsorship in the US. Green For All seemed to like me and would like to sponsor me, but they are checking if that&#8217;s feasible for the organization. My LR needed me to go back to LA as soon as possible for some documents, and plus, I only have 2 weeks to relocate to Oakland if everything passes. This was Saturday morning when I realized I should be home (plus it&#8217;s good to meet my FD meeting). Dave told me earlier, if I needed to go home early, give the keys to a guy name NK who goes there every night to do work. Unfortunately, he did not show up Friday night (quite understandable)I facebooked him, emailed him, called him 6 times in 8 hours, and there were no response. I also couldn&#8217;t get in touch with Dave. After resolving a small issue within the company at 5PM, I realized I needed to leave, or else I would be driving in horrendous status. I decided that, at least I don&#8217;t want things to be worse because of my visit, so I would take the keys to where I found it. That&#8217;s another hour of driving.</p>\n<p>Early in the day, I also called my friend who is taking over my apartment. Amy gave her my keys because she needs to show case it for potential subletters. I called her in the morning, could not get in touch with her, so I left her a message. Pretty much saying that I will be back and I need my keys so I will have a place to live. On my trip back, about 6pm, she called back and informed me she was actually at Las Vegas. Well, I guess I need to find a place to stay when I&#8217;m back home too now, or I could sleep on my car.</p>\n<p>The best part comes here. While it was around 7PM, I became pretty hungry because I have eaten that day was a footlong Veggie Delite from Subway. The solution? Another Veggie Delite from Subway. I&#8217;m trying to become more veggie, since I&#8217;m not too picky on what I eat. I was listening to my podcast with earphones connected to the iphone in my pocket when I felt I should urinate before I go back on my trip. While I was unzipping, my arms dragged the earphone cords, and pulled the iphone right out of my pocket, straight into the public toilet. The splash was mild, swift and smooth. But the gasp to my mind was not. There was this 1/4 of a second &#8220;should I reach into the toilet and grab it??&#8221; before I actually executed it. I tried to dry it up, and it said that it could no longer detect a SIM card. It then finally completely shut off and died. I tried to get the water out of the iphone, but after some shaky, it didn&#8217;t do much. Then I decided to blow air into the iphone. That&#8217;s when a lot of water suddenly splashed out onto my face. It was quite a lot of water, and it certainly was not very appealing, especially when you know it&#8217;s public toilet water.</p>\n<p>After my Veggie Delite (it was still delicious I must confess), I was driving on the road, knowing that I would be doing so for another 4 hours without business podcasts, and without communication to the outside world. What&#8217;s worse, I told Amy that I will pick her up from a friend&#8217;s place at 1AM when I get back, and I didn&#8217;t know where the friend was. Now there&#8217;s no way for me to coordinate with her when I get there. Things seemed rather tragic.</p>\n<p>Finally another bright light in the dark night. I realized I was really close to Arroyo Grande, where my good friend Nancy owns a 600 acre ranch. Another friend who I worked with in the <a href=\"http://sustainabilitycoalition.org\">California Student Sustainability Coalition</a> (where I was the Finance Director), Michael Cox, also lives there. I appeared at his place about 10PM, and saw that he was having a party. It was actually a tiny bit awkward for me, because I remember him inviting me to this party, but I said I couldn&#8217;t make it. When I showed up, people were like &#8220;Oh, Yu-kai! What a pleasant surprise!&#8221; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were coming!&#8221; &#8220;Yay!&#8221; when in fact, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m only here to borrow a phone so I can call my girlfriend.&#8221; This was especially weird to me, because some of the people there I have only seen for the first time in my life. We have worked together on the phone, but never physically met, and that&#8217;s the best kind of &#8220;great finally meeting you!&#8221; I could do. Others I have heard about but it&#8217;s the first time we had any sort of interaction. I stayed for about 20 minutes to share my trip with Michael and Crystal Durham (ED of the CSSC), used the phone to tell Amy that I will pick her up at an exact location at 1:15AM, and left again.</p>\n<p>At this point, I was getting somewhat tired and delirious. It&#8217;s not common for a person to drive 7 hours after an intensive work day starting 5PM. I almost got into 12 accidents, including driving off the ramp and what not. I felt like resting, but I wasn&#8217;t able to, because I had to catch the 1:15AM pickup time or else Amy would be left in the cold. When I finally go there, it was 1:15 right on the point. I couldn&#8217;t find her, so I parked the car, and fell asleep right away. Amy then woke me up, and made me realize that there was a misunderstanding, and she thought we would be meeting at 1:30.</p>\n<p>Once picking Amy up, that concluded a very eventful trip. Life is still good, besides needing to replace the phone. Now I just hope my sponsorship issue would turn out to be no problem. Whoever&#8217;s reading this, I appreciate you actually getting to this line. Hope you have an awesome week and that you will be successful in every activity you engage in!</p>\n",

Instead of being 15 minutes away from Dave&#8217;s apartment now, I was an hour away, so I needed to wake up earlier in the morning.</p>\n<p>The next day I got to the interview 5 minutes late, mostly due to unfamiliarity with the parking in Oakland and complicated one-way streets. The interview went great, and I made a good connetion with Green For All. Since I was close, I thought I might as well use the garage opener to get into Dave&#8217;s apartment&#8217;s building and use his wifi to get in touch with him. That&#8217;s when I realized that didn&#8217;t work either. After I found a wifi connection somewhere else, I found Dave online and told him that I couldn&#8217;t find the key. He was in shock, and after some investigation he realized that someone changed the arrangement. The garage remote I had was for another house close to where I found it, and I was supposed to use that to open the garage door, go into the house, and get the keys. So due to that, I drove another 50 minutes to that place, got the keys, and another 50 minutes back (extra 30 minutes to drop off shoes to Peter). I got into the apartment and everything is happy. I could stay there for 2 weeks comfortably while doing some good work.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I talked to my Legal Representitive talked to me about my sponsorship in the US. Green For All seemed to like me and would like to sponsor me, but they are checking if that&#8217;s feasible for the organization. My LR needed me to go back to LA as soon as possible for some documents, and plus, I only have 2 weeks to relocate to Oakland if everything passes. This was Saturday morning when I realized I should be home (plus it&#8217;s good to meet my FD meeting). Dave told me earlier, if I needed to go home early, give the keys to a guy name NK who goes there every night to do work. Unfortunately, he did not show up Friday night (quite understandable)I facebooked him, emailed him, called him 6 times in 8 hours, and there were no response. I also couldn&#8217;t get in touch with Dave. After resolving a small issue within the company at 5PM, I realized I needed to leave, or else I would be driving in horrendous status. I decided that, at least I don&#8217;t want things to be worse because of my visit, so I would take the keys to where I found it. That&#8217;s another hour of driving.</p>\n<p>Early in the day, I also called my friend who is taking over my apartment. Amy gave her my keys because she needs to show case it for potential subletters. I called her in the morning, could not get in touch with her, so I left her a message. Pretty much saying that I will be back and I need my keys so I will have a place to live. On my trip back, about 6pm, she called back and informed me she was actually at Las Vegas. Well, I guess I need to find a place to stay when I&#8217;m back home too now, or I could sleep on my car.</p>\n<p>The best part comes here. While it was around 7PM, I became pretty hungry because I have eaten that day was a footlong Veggie Delite from Subway. The solution? Another Veggie Delite from Subway. I&#8217;m trying to become more veggie, since I&#8217;m not too picky on what I eat. I was listening to my podcast with earphones connected to the iphone in my pocket when I felt I should urinate before I go back on my trip. While I was unzipping, my arms dragged the earphone cords, and pulled the iphone right out of my pocket, straight into the public toilet. The splash was mild, swift and smooth. But the gasp to my mind was not. There was this 1/4 of a second &#8220;should I reach into the toilet and grab it??&#8221; before I actually executed it. I tried to dry it up, and it said that it could no longer detect a SIM card. It then finally completely shut off and died. I tried to get the water out of the iphone, but after some shaky, it didn&#8217;t do much. Then I decided to blow air into the iphone. That&#8217;s when a lot of water suddenly splashed out onto my face. It was quite a lot of water, and it certainly was not very appealing, especially when you know it&#8217;s public toilet water.</p>\n<p>After my Veggie Delite (it was still delicious I must confess), I was driving on the road, knowing that I would be doing so for another 4 hours without business podcasts, and without communication to the outside world. What&#8217;s worse, I told Amy that I will pick her up from a friend&#8217;s place at 1AM when I get back, and I didn&#8217;t know where the friend was. Now there&#8217;s no way for me to coordinate with her when I get there. Things seemed rather tragic.</p>\n<p>Finally another bright light in the dark night. I realized I was really close to Arroyo Grande, where my good friend Nancy owns a 600 acre ranch. Another friend who I worked with in the <a href=\"http://sustainabilitycoalition.org\">California Student Sustainability Coalition</a> (where I was the Finance Director), Michael Cox, also lives there. I appeared at his place about 10PM, and saw that he was having a party. It was actually a tiny bit awkward for me, because I remember him inviting me to this party, but I said I couldn&#8217;t make it. When I showed up, people were like &#8220;Oh, Yu-kai! What a pleasant surprise!&#8221; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were coming!&#8221; &#8220;Yay!&#8221; when in fact, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m only here to borrow a phone so I can call my girlfriend.&#8221; This was especially weird to me, because some of the people there I have only seen for the first time in my life. We have worked together on the phone, but never physically met, and that&#8217;s the best kind of &#8220;great finally meeting you!&#8221; I could do. Others I have heard about but it&#8217;s the first time we had any sort of interaction. I stayed for about 20 minutes to share my trip with Michael and Crystal Durham (ED of the CSSC), used the phone to tell Amy that I will pick her up at an exact location at 1:15AM, and left again.</p>\n<p>At this point, I was getting somewhat tired and delirious. It&#8217;s not common for a person to drive 7 hours after an intensive work day starting 5PM. I almost got into 12 accidents, including driving off the ramp and what not. I felt like resting, but I wasn&#8217;t able to, because I had to catch the 1:15AM pickup time or else Amy would be left in the cold. When I finally go there, it was 1:15 right on the point. I couldn&#8217;t find her, so I parked the car, and fell asleep right away. Amy then woke me up, and made me realize that there was a misunderstanding, and she thought we would be meeting at 1:30.</p>\n<p>Once picking Amy up, that concluded a very eventful trip. Life is still good, besides needing to replace the phone. Now I just hope my sponsorship issue would turn out to be no problem. Whoever&#8217;s reading this, I appreciate you actually getting to this line. Hope you have an awesome week and that you will be successful in every activity you engage in!</p>\n",

While I do think it\u2019s great to have diversity, I think having the admission program go easy on some groups rather than others is not the real solution to a problem. I believe the problem extends from culture and value backgrounds of different groups. The university admission system is obliged to take students that are most fit to study and compete in an academic environment(which yes, I will agree that the way they identify \u201cfitness\u201d is completely flawed, but they try). In some cases, we probably all notice that schools also take the best fit people to compete against other schools in certain sports/activities.</p>\n<h3>Some cultures value grades over balance</h3>\n<p>Now I\u2019m not looking to get into the zone of being politically correct or incorrect, but I will state beforehand that this blog is mostly about criticizing some Asian cultures and values. I think if a kid studies all day long since the first grade, gets extra practice problems when she finishes homework while others are outside playing, stresses about college and SATs since freshman year of high school, gets \u201cillegal punishment\u201d from berserk parents every time she gets a B in class, and takes on all those extracurricular activities that she may or may not like, just to get into a good college, she probably deserves to get into a decent college (at least compared to the kid who just played games most of the time).</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think any group is really smarter than another, but just some groups have the cultural background to study like it\u2019s their destiny so that they don\u2019t embarrass their families, ancestors, and everyone that is affiliated with them. Asians aren\u2019t really good at math (To save my ass: I simply hear this comment a lot and I do not endorse this statement); it\u2019s kids who do 20 practice problems everyday after finishing their homework since third grade that are good at math(which regrettably or not, was not me).</p>\n<p>Luckily, issues that disadvantage college minority groups can change, and should change. I believe that providing a better education as well as promoting more studious environments and values among the minority groups from elementary school to high school is the true solution for diversity in college. With good policy making, these are all possible.</p>\n<h3>Fit vs Diversity in Sports or the Entertainment Industry?</h3>\n<p>If you want to speak about diversity (and discrimination) on things that can\u2019t change, I propose that every NBA team should require at least 2 White guys and an Asian guy (which still isn\u2019t fair in the absolute sense) on the floor at all times, as there seems to be a clear absence in diversity in the name of &#8220;fit&#8221;.</p>\n<p>We might even need to make a rule that the Asian guy should have the ball at least 3 times in a game, because that probably won\u2019t happen without.</p>\n<p>We also might consider having diversity in physical attractiveness in the entertainment industry, because if you pay close attention to the industry often, you might notice that non-gorgeous looking people seem to be discriminated in getting lead roles in movies and such.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, universities look for people that have the best potentials in being successful in society after graduation, so the reputation of the school would expand, as well as receive some alumni donations. It is true that by just looking at GPA, SAT scores, some extracurricular activities and a couple essays, you can\u2019t really tell if one would be successful in society, but that\u2019s how the university works even throughout college and into the work force, and until you figure out a better way that is cost-effective, there is no point in blaming the school itself.</p>\n<h3>Why do Asians study like crazy?</h3>\n<p>So why do Asians study like crazy anyway? What\u2019s wrong with them? It\u2019s really ingrained in the Asian culture that studying is everything. Getting into a good college is more like an end itself, rather than a means to an end, which is to get a successful job.</p>\n<p>As I went back to Taiwan and saw my Grandfather(88), after six years of not seeing his only grandson, one of the first things he asked was, \u201cwhen are you going to get your masters?\u201d Oh yea, not being here for awhile, I forgot that whether I want to get a masters or not isn\u2019t even a question.</p>\n<p>My aunt showed similar kindness as she innocently mentions, \u201cwhen you get your masters in this degree, I\u2019ll do blah blah blah\u201d (blah is Mandarin Chinese, so don\u2019t even try to read it).</p>\n<p>If I was still in middle school, whether I wanted to be a doctor or not would not have been a question either. These are just all assumed: if you can be a doctor, be a doctor, and if you can get a masters, get one.</p>\n<p>Now being an entrepreneur doesn\u2019t require an obliterating amount of education, but I remained polite so I won\u2019t piss off the whole family and put my parents in shame. They who started to save money for my education(almost $40,000 a year including living fees) since they were married deserve to have some peace.</p>\n<h3>Going back to ancient China</h3>\n<p>So the reason why many Asian groups value education and degrees comes from the ancient traditions in China. During the old days, and I mean so old that I didn\u2019t even know how to ride a bicycle, the only way to become rich and prosperous is to take this mammoth national exam, score well, and become a government official.</p>\n<p>During the time, most people were only peasant farmers and could not afford an education. The ones who did went for an education, which is pretty much a no-brainer even without the education.</p>\n<p>Once you score well on the exam and become a government officer, supposedly you will bring prosperity and honor to all your family and ancestors. You basically aren\u2019t worthless anymore in a monarchy society once you have some kind of scholarly title.</p>\n<p>It has been that for thousands of years, and scholars were always the most looked up upon, as kings and emperors always listened to them(think Confucius).</p>\n<h3>Western cultures view education as a means to a great career instead of an end to itself</h3>\n<p>In the US, things are a bit different. People look up to individuals like Bill Gates, who quit his degree at Harvard, started Microsoft and were able to pay his bills quite well, while having some extras for entertainment.</p>\n<p>The whole system of what is \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cprestigious\u201d has some differences in the cultures. In the US, being prosperous IS prestigious, excluding activities such as drug dealing etc.</p>\n<p>At this point I shall admit that I have been talking in extremes and absolutes, and that a common idea of prestige and such is still shared among the cultures. It is impossible to talk about any group as a whole without making statements that are generic with tons of exceptions. I have only been talking on a relative basis, as a PhD is certainly prestigious in the US, just not AS valued as in an Asian society.</p>\n<p>In many Western countries, education is the means to an end. You go to school so you can get a better job with your better degree. Many times you can evaluate is it worth the money to get that education(and I have learned in my econometric class at UCLA, that according to some data, on average you only make around 46 cents more per hour after each year of schooling).</p>\n<p>But in Asian societies, getting a strong degree is almost like an end, for the strong social status(which is also created in people\u2019s mind) of a high degree is the determination of if one is successful.</p>\n<p>I can almost say in modest certainty that many Asian parents would be prouder of a child who went to Harvard but for some reason couldn\u2019t find a good job than one who went to a bad college but has an extraordinary job.</p>\n<h3>Unconvinced: Do these kids really study like crazy?</h3>\n<p>OK, some people pointed out that I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, and people in the US value education the same way. Let me tell you this to be convincing:</p>\n<p>A good amount of middle school students from Taiwan live like this (this includes many many of my personal friends): they would go to school at 7:30AM. School ends at 5:00PM. Then they go to after-school school to improve in school (like a Kaplan except 60% of the students are forced to go by their parents), leave after-school school at 10PM. Then they have to finish after-school school homework, and then their real school homework, and then they go to bed.</p>\n<p>As far as I know, not that many middle school students live like this in the US. A few years back, students needed to go to school on Saturdays too (they Westernized). And in your 3rd year of middle school, you are forced to stay in school to study for your exam till 8PM every day.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another example. I remember those annoying tests that for every problem you get wrong, the teacher takes a big stick and hits you in the palm. It hurt like crap. When that happens, it&#8217;s always a long line of students waiting to be hit by the teacher. Do the parents go to school and yell at the teacher? No. The parents go to school to APOLOGIZE that their children created problems for the teacher.</p>\n<p>In the US culture, parents have more power than teachers. But in many Asian cultures (I know Taiwan best, but many other Asian friends confirmed the same thing), the teachers have more power than the parents and the parents are often apologizing. That&#8217;s just a difference in cultural value.</p>\n<h3>Some observed dysfunctions of valuing grades over everything</h3>\n<p>For many Asian students, getting into an university is where life ends. Then another life independent of their past starts once they get out of college. However, there are some negative consequences to it, besides the high stress and suicide rates of students.</p>\n<p>Since getting into college is everything, once students from Asia (not Asian students in the US, and no not ALL countries) get into top universities, they start to slack and have fun all day, instead of really acquiring knowledge as they are there for. The system also makes it that your GPA hardly matters as long as you pass, so that\u2019s all people aim for. Getting into graduate school is simply determined by another test at the end of college years.</p>\n<p>I know this because I every friend I talked to who grew up in Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea all said in middle school and high school, they were extremely stressed and suicide rates were higher. Once people get in college, what people do all day is slack off. &#8220;They made it, so it&#8217;s time to relax instead of learning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For that reason, when it comes to universities, students in the US actually study harder than those in Asia (yea, amazing right? Even after all that partying). This clearly shows that it&#8217;s pretty dysfunctional when a culture places the value of &#8220;grades&#8221; over &#8220;education.&#8221; You&#8217;re not there to learn, you are there to score.</p>\n<p>This is just some thoughts based on the observations I have in society and an attempt to explain the origins of it. If you happen to disagree with anything and have better insights about things, feel free to criticize this and enlighten me. Politeness is appreciated but sometimes too much to ask for from Anonymous Commentors, so trolls are welcome too.

I believe that providing a better education as well as promoting more studious environments and values among the minority groups from elementary school to high school is the true solution for diversity in college. With good policy making, these are all possible. If you want to speak about diversity(and discrimination) on things that can\u2019t change, I propose that every NBA team be required to have at least 2 White guys and an Asian guy(which still isn\u2019t fair in the absolute sense) on the floor at all times, as there seems to be a clear absence in diversity in substitute of being fit. We might even need to make a rule that the Asian guy should have the ball at least 3 times in a game, because that probably won\u2019t happen without. We also might consider having diversity in physical attractiveness in the entertainment industry, because if you pay close attention to the industry often, you might notice that non-gorgeous looking people seem to be discriminated in getting lead roles in movies and such.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, universities look for people that have the best potentials in being successful in society after graduation, so the reputation of the school would expand, as well as receive some alumni donations. It is true that by just looking at GPA, SAT scores, some extracurricular activities and a couple essays, you can\u2019t really tell if one would be successful in society, but that\u2019s how the university works even throughout college and into the work force, and until you figure out a better way that is cost-effective, there is no point in blaming the school.</p>\n<p>So why do Asians study like crazy anyway? What\u2019s wrong with them? It\u2019s really ingrained in the Asian culture that studying is everything. Getting into a good college is more like an end itself, rather than a means to an end, which is to get a successful job. As I went back to Taiwan and saw my Grandfather(88), after six years of not seeing his only grandson, one of the first things he asked was, \u201cwhen are you going to get your masters?\u201d Oh yea, not being here for awhile, I forgot that whether I want to get a masters or not isn\u2019t even a question. My aunt showed similar kindness as she innocently mentions, \u201cwhen you get your masters in this degree, I\u2019ll be blah blah blah\u201d (blah is Mandarin Chinese, so don\u2019t even try to read it). If I was still in middle school, whether I wanted to be a doctor or not would not have been a question either. These are just all assumed: if you can be a doctor, be a doctor, and if you can get a masters, get one. Now being an entrepreneur doesn\u2019t require an obliterating amount of education, but I remained polite so I won\u2019t piss off the whole family and put my parents in shame. They who started to save money for my education(almost $40,000 a year including living fees) since they were married deserve to have some peace.</p>\n<p>So the reason why many Asian groups value education and degrees comes from the ancient traditions in China. During the old days, and I mean so old that I didn\u2019t even know how to ride a bicycle, the only way to become rich and prosperous is to take this mammoth national exam, score well, and become a government official. During the time, most people were only peasant farmers and could not afford an education. The ones who did went for an education, which is pretty much a no-brainer even without the education. Once you score well on the exam and become a government officer, supposedly you will bring prosperity and honor to all your family and ancestors. You basically aren\u2019t worthless anymore in a monarchy society once you have some kind of scholarly title. It has been that for thousands of years, and scholars were always the most looked up upon, as kings and emperors always listen to them(think Confucius).</p>\n<p>In the US, things are a bit different. People look up to individuals like Bill Gates, who quit his degree at Harvard, started Microsoft and were able to pay his bills quite well, while having some extras for entertainment. The whole system of what is \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cprestigious\u201d has some differences in the cultures. In the US, being prosperous IS prestigious, excluding activities such as drug dealing etc. At this point I shall admit that I have been talking in extremes and absolutes, and that a common idea of prestige and such is still shared among the cultures. I have only been talking on a relative basis, as a PhD is certainly prestigious in the US, just not AS valued as in an Asian society.</p>\n<p>In many Western countries, education is the means to an end. You go to school so you can get a better job with your better degree. Many times you can evaluate is it worth the money to get that education(and I have learned in an econometric class, that according to some data, on average you only make around 46 cents more per hour after each year of schooling). But in Asian societies, getting a strong degree is almost like an end, for the strong social status(which is also created in people\u2019s mind) of a high degree is the determination of if one is successful. I can almost say in modest certainty that many Asian parents would be prouder of a child who went to Harvard but for some reason couldn\u2019t find a good job than one who went to a bad college but has an extraordinary job. For many Asian students, getting into an university is where life ends. Then another life independent of their past starts once they get out of college. However, there are some negative consequences to it, besides the high stress and suicide rates of students. Since getting into college is everything, once Asia students get into top universities, they start to slack and have fun all day, instead of really acquiring knowledge as they are there for. The system also makes it that your GPA hardly matters as long as you pass, so that\u2019s all people aim for. Getting into graduate school is simply determined by another test at the end of college years.</p>\n<p>Another issue is that since students only aim to get the most prestigious degree, few people really look at what they like and what are their talents in life. It\u2019s a simple life-draining competition that determines a hierarchy in society. I plan to explain further the shortcomings of Asia\u2019s education system, but seeing that this blog/article is long enough and no one will read it anyway, I thought I\u2019ll give it a rest. This is just some thoughts based on the observations I have in society and an attempt to explain the origins of it. If you happen to disagree with anything and have better insights about things, feel free to criticize this and enlighten me. Have a great time!</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>To run a start up, the leader has to make sure everything in peoples&#8217; lives are going well. Working in a startup is not a career, it is a lifestyle. You count the hours you don&#8217;t work, and you live and breathe your products. For this reason, my job is not only to make sure everyone has a fulfilling and meaningful career, but also a fulfilling and meaningful lifestyle. Even when the business is going well in every way, personal issues become some of the the toughest challenges in a start up. Family members usually never support working at a startup due to the high risk and initial low compensation, and they give a lot of pressure to startup people, as if there are not enough problems already. In this case, I wrote to our programmer&#8217;s grandfather and hope he would approval of what we are doing.</p>\n<p>Hello Mr [omit],</p>\n<p>How are you doing? I hope life is treating you well! I noticed that Steven has not responded to your email for awhile, so I said he should email you, and then I thought it would be a good idea for me to write you an email too, since that might make you more comfortable with what he is doing here. I felt bad a month and a half ago when Steven told me that he realizes you are visiting him from Aspen and would miss him. During that time, I have actually just returned to CA from Aspen too. I was invited to help out at a conference &#8220;Selling without Selling Out: CEOs of socially responsible companies that are bought out by internationals&#8221; (I&#8217;m just a helper and do not qualify for that title). I got to meet the founders/CEOs of Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s, Odwalla, Dagoba Chocalate, and a few other great people on a very intimate level, and I have learned a great lot there. Aspen is a great place to be, and if I had known earlier, I would have paid you a visit too there! (assuming you welcomed that obviously)</p>\n<p>Future Delivery plans to develop a continous and long term relationship with Steven. Steven and I were good buddies from awhile back. We went to the same high school quite awhile ago. I used to teach him chess and take him to chess tournaments, as well as worked very hard to prevent him from failing Forensics class. It wasn&#8217;t a subject that he cared to put much time into, haha. After going to college (UCLA), I became an entrepreneur, and have spent every hour of my spare time trying to build good businesses that make a positive impact in society. Before I gradauted, I conceptualized the concept of converting a virtual world (usually used for gaming and escapism) into a professional tool where people can do business and find jobs in. Essentially, it is a game where, the more hours you spend on it, the more productive you are (our company motto is combine work and play in every single way). The concept is appealing in the sense that we recruited some top talents in the industry, including our CTO, who is a senior engineer in Toshiba, holds 24 patents, teaches at UC Irvine, and was the first employee for Xerox in China. We also put together a very strong board of advisors, including the founder of Google Adsense, the founder of the Google Earth company, the lawyer who worked on the News Corp &#8211; Myspace aquisition, and the accountant who worked on the eBay-Skype aquisition.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m building the business, I kept in touch with my high school friends. Steven and others were extremely interested in the project we were doing, and were interested in helping out. Good programmers are always looking for good projects to work on. I heard that Steven, along with Mike and Tony, were very good programmers, and I thought of something that is very intriguing. When I tell the Californian folks that I am from Kansas, they all say it is very random. I thought it would be quite awesome if we formed a Blue Valley team that would become famous when the company starts to make a big impact. The goal is to have it so that, a decade later, when people hear about Kansas, the first things they think about are Jay Hawks, Oz, and Blue Valley. Working with old friends are obviously very fun too. So even though we had a lot of resources and talented people here in California, I invited them to come, and tour around CA too. I&#8217;m sure you will agree that travelling and learning from different places and cultures are invaluable experiences that school can never install in you.</p>\n<p>So here they are working at our Summer internship. Because of the low resource and nature of the startup, we declared very early before they agreed that they won&#8217;t be paid a wage. They came here purely for the fun and challenging project, experience, and seeing CA (besides Steven I would say). After they came, I decided to give them each 5,000 amount of stock options, which may or may not be valuable in the future. Since we plan to build a longterm and continous relationship with Steven, later on we will defintely pay him in the future when we have the resources. Right now we all are at an apartment work station close to UCLA, and half of it is for sleeping, a quarter of it is the work place, and a quarter of it is the gaming place. Right now me, Tony, Steven, Mike, and another person name Chan live here. Besides Chan, we are all from the same high school. Mike goes to UI-Urbana Chapagn (the 4th best school in computer science), and Tony goes to KU. I try my hardest in making sure they have a good environment and are having fun here (which is what the company stands for). I cover their living costs, cook for them, do their dishes, do their laundary, and take them to places. I also sponsored accupressue massages for them. We&#8217;re all here to have fun, do good work, and make life more meaningful.</p>\n<p>As for the hours, Steven pretty much does everything on his own hours. He would sit in front of his computer, work, surf the net, play games, work a bit, and then go and play video games. It seems like he&#8217;s only interested in his computer, video games, and eating. Everyone here plays video games freely, and since I know Steven has an ingrained interest in getting the codes to work, I don&#8217;t really monitor much. He&#8217;ll do it if it is work that he likes. I&#8217;m not sure if that answers your question.</p>\n<p>Finally, I did make plans to take them to a lot of places around Southeran California, including famous beaches, Disney Land, Universal Studios, Getty Center and such. However, it seems that Steven and Mike are not interested in going anywhere. Only Tony is excited to go to places. I didn&#8217;t want to force them to spend money and go to places that they don&#8217;t want to go, so I often let them stay home and play video games and sometimes only Tony goes to certain places. Steven and Mike are really the type that prefer to sit in front of their computers or play video games. However, I did emphasize that being outdoors is important, and made them go out and play basketball once. That is when I realized Steven never played it before and does not even know the rules. Mike also felt it was torture. I also promote walking whenever we can, instead of driving. At this point, I&#8217;ve only been able to show Steven Chinatown, Korea Town, Hollywood, Walk of Stars, Chinese Theater, Disney Concert Hall and the UCLA campus. He says that since you suggest it, we can go to the Getty Center to take a look (it is just 10 minutes away). I hope I can take him to more fun places, but it probably depends on his consent.</p>\n<p>That pretty much sums up how his life has been here in Los Angeles. I hope I addressed most of your concerns, and feel free to ask more. I know the email is pretty long so I do thank you for reading all of it. I thought it is something that is important in your mind, so I decided to elaborate more on it. I know that you would still like to talk to Steven, so I suggested him to call you in the near future. I think he will do so soon. Anyway, I hope you have a great week, and that you will be successful in every activity you engage in!</p>\n<p>With Sincerity and Respect,<br />\nYu-kai Chou<br />\nCEO<br />\nFuture Delivery<br />\nTel: 323.633.8323<br />\nFax: 866.734.3124&#8243;</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>Networking and building relationships with people is one of the most essential things one needs to do to become successful. When you want to contact someone and meet up(newly met professional or old friend), you want to find a common interest to make the meeting pleasant and enjoyable for both. Maybe you both like golf. Maybe you would both like to visit a museum. But what if you don\u2019t know what that person likes? In that case, there is a pretty universal common interest: <a title=\"Food\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food\" target=\"_blank\">food</a>. Statistics show that most people deal with some sort of food one time or another in their lives. It also happens that most people like food. So it\u2019s pretty safe to invite this person to a good food place when you don\u2019t know enough about him/her. If the food is good, timing is possible, and maybe you\u2019ll be treating them (and it\u2019s worth it), most people wouldn\u2019t mind getting some food and talking to you.<br />\nWhen you are talking to a new professional, make sure you don\u2019t put too much focus on his or her professional information and forget about the personal things in his/her life. It doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re highly successful people, they\u2019re still people, and until you show that you care about them as real people instead of their titles, you will have a hard time building a true relationship.</p>\n<p>In regards to conversations, if you know the person likes something that you don\u2019t, do not lie and<br />\npretend you like it. You\u2019ll lose any sense of credibility very soon. You could reveal that you do not know much about that topic but is interested to learn about it. That\u2019s a good way to have a good conversation on something without needing much knowledge to it. Most people like explaining and teaching things they are passionate about, as long as you can keep yourself from drooling. However, besides having an open mind to learn, being genuinely concerned about the other person often helps in being more interested towards subjects that he/she is passionate about.<br />\nIf you know what makes people smile, your day will turn out much better.</p>\n",

I am a firm believer of the concept of, instead of coming up with great concepts and having great execution, get people with great concepts and great execution on the board. As a leader, my biggest job is to get great people on the team and make them even better. With a strong vision of making society better by connecting people to the careers that they are passionate about, I am blessed to have an extremely qualified, passionate, execution-focused team that has complementary skills.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://junloayza.com\" title=\"Jun's Site\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jun Loayza:</strong></a> My CMO (Chief Millennial Officer) Jun is completely Godsend. Jun and I met at the Business Fraternity of Delta Sigma Pi in 2005, and had since talked to him at least two times a week on average. Jun has a few natural talents. He is a natural speaker, and is extremely personal with all his engagements. Being one of the most presentable people I know (haha), Jun impresses people the moment he starts his first sentence. There&#8217;s been moments and Jun starts to talk, whoever listens goes &#8220;whoa, this guy speaks so well.&#8221; I remember the first time I met him, he was doing a presentation, and as soon as he started speaking, I made a determination to become friends with him, which happened 25 minutes afterwards. Many times when I or someone else makes a presentation, with Jun just making an introduction, there would always be a group of people swarming around Jun, asking him questions regarding the presentation, and the speaker might just have 3-4 people talking to him. It is even to the extent that whenever the programmers had an personal issue, instead of talking to the CTO or me, they would call Jun, the furthest removed CMO, and ask him. Jun is that good at being personable.</p>\n<p>MORE importantly, Jun is extraordinary in execution skills. I have met and worked with a lot of people, ages between 14 and 55, many of them highly intellectual and successful, but Jun definitely is one of the top top among them when it comes down to execution skills. If the goal was to meet as many recruiters at a career fair, Jun will go around the room for 2 hours, meet ALL 55 recruiters while making a personal expression with each, go home, and send a personal followup email to all of them within an hour and half. On one Friday he decided that Future Delivery needed to have a whole series of podcasts (4 hours of audio), an eBook on making yourself stick out to employers (30 pages) and 6 videocasts all by Monday. On Monday, he had it all finished. The eBook received a lot of great compliments from people who downloaded from the site, and the audio series became very helpful for those who recruited.</p>\n<p>Finally, Jun is essential in creating the right culture for Future Delivery. Jun created the Premiere Business Organization in UCLA called Bruin Consulting that took UCLA by storm just in 1 quarter. As president, he created a culture of &#8220;fun-loving people who want to do good work.&#8221; In FD, he remains to support that culture of combining work and play. Every meeting with him is not dull but full of laughter, and our brainstorm sessions involve the &#8220;trash/genius&#8221; model, which creates a lot of idea synergy and moves things quickly. Future Delivery can never and will never be what it is, or what it wants to be, without Jun Loayza.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason Wei: </strong>My CTO Jason is one of the top top people in the programming industry. After getting his double-major in computer science and business administration in China, he was the first employee Xerox hired in China, and he set up the whole Xerox system there. He also started his own medical device company with a few other partners, and for 2 years there were no technological competition. In 2001 (7 years later), he sold his shares, and it still operates today. When he moved to the US, both Microsoft and Toshiba wanted to give him his green card, he chose Toshiba because of their flexibility in projects. He also teaches at UC Irvine as a extension lecturer and has built up a fan base among his students. What&#8217;s interesting is that he became a lecturer because he was taking a class there, and his professor was so impressed, that he proposed that Jason should teach the class. In addition, the reason why Jason chose to come to the US, is that in his whole career in China, he has only met 1 other programmer who is just flat out better than him. When he came to the states, at the top level at these top tech firms, he already met a few people who was better than him. That excited him and made him want to live in the states.</p>\n<p>Jason, due to his green card issue, has not been able to work for FD fulltime yet. He has done a lot of solid research on all the resources out there and made a lot of planning, but I look forward to the day he can commit fully and create the most value in FD and this world.</p>\n<p><strong>Cat Sze: </strong>From the beginning of our company, we had troubles finding the right Art Director. We felt that there are a lot of designers, but there are very few truly creative artists who also understands user-friendiness. We looked for a long time, covering a lot of places, including Taiwan, and had trouble finding a good one that has played with virtual worlds. We worked with another excellent artist/designer, but due to high loans, he was stolen to help out Guitar Hero 4 (FD should boycott it :)) And then we got Cat. Cat graduated from the Art Center of Design in Pasadena, one of the most prestigious design schools in the US. Cat has been an avid gaming and virtual world fan since the beginning. She is a hardcore player of World of Warcraft, and is a moderator for Gaia Online, another virtual world company. She also studies a lot of business content.</p>\n<p>Cat is the perfect combination of being a creative artist/designer, familiar with virtual worlds, understanding the target market, and having good business sense.</p>\n",

(How many of you are afraid of approaching a boss in a video game?)</p>\n<p>As I pointed out in another post , <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/lifestyle-gamification/6-core-values-of-fd-networking/\">good networking has 6 Core Values: Integrity, Sincerity, Optimism, Confidence, Initiative, and Persistence</a>. As long as you constantly apply these 6 core concepts in your life, doors will open up in life for you.</p>\n<h3>1. Decide on the Objectives of the Game</h3>\n<p>In order to find the right mentors and advisors, you need to first know what are your objectives. Are you trying to create a scalable business? Are you trying to solve certain technology issues?</p>\n<h3>2. Identify the Kind of Advisors you would need for your Objective</h3>\n<p>Once you know what your objectives are, create a list of skill sets and experiences that you need to assist you further. Be as detailed as you can, such as &#8220;Someone who has 20 years in this field, has brought at least one company successful, and is local to my city.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>3. Create a Hunt-List of Qualified Advisors</h3>\n<p>This requires some work. You need to go on LinkedIn, go to conferences (and especially check out the speaker list), read the press, and identify a list of super powerful individuals that could be your advisors. Don&#8217;t be timid in adding the strongest folks in this list. You never know.</p>\n<h3>4. Start the Hunt</h3>\n<p>The next step is to hunt for these advisors. In this day and age, it is easy to find their traces online and possibly offline. See what social networks they spend a lot of time in. See if they have a blog and have a podcast show. Also, pay attention if they are going to conferences soon.</p>\n<h3>5. Soften up the Ice</h3>\n<div>\u00a0Before you reach out directly to them, go to a few of the places that they have presence, and create some interaction about that. If they have a blog, comment on their posts a few times. If they are on Twitter, Retweet and respond to their tweets.</div>\n<h3>6. The Direct hit</h3>\n<div>After some soft engagements, write a respectable email, social network message, or approach them at a conference, and say, &#8220;Hello, I&#8217;m _____. We&#8217;ve had a few back and forths on your blog. I&#8217;m working on a [2-3 sentence]. I was wondering if I could have a conversation with you sometime for the purpose of you potentially being one of our advisors. I think your experiences in _____ would make you perfect and I believe YOU will be the one that helps us become successful.&#8221; If you have done everything well from before (including truly finding the right and relevant person), you have a good chance of making it.</div>\n<h3>7. Sell as usual</h3>\n<p>During the meeting, you should sell your company just like you would to any investor. Get this advisor excited. Get this advisor to like you. Also, be clear on expectations of what you want from an advisor and what you would give for it. I recommend\u00a0guaranteeing a monthly 1-hour phone call, as well as in-person board meetings once a quarter. Most startups give out \u00a0about 0.1%-0.5% of the company for a good advisor that is willing to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">commit.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>8. Add a point on your LeaderBoard</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you have gotten this advisor to help you, give yourself a brownie point and then go for the next one!</p>\n<p>Throughout my career, I have firmly believed that, when you meet passionate and motivated people with a sincere attitude, only good things can happen. Building relationships is one of the most important and meaningful things you can do in life, regardless if it is for professional or personal enrichment. To apply another Gamification Analogy: Outside the comfort zone there is a <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/lifestyle-gamification/outside-the-comfort-zone-the-harmless-dragon/\">harmless dragon</a> that looks scary, but you are invincible to it. Once you realize there is nothing you can lose by approaching and talking to more people, you will be ready to slay the harmless dragon.</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>Some people were curious about how Future Delivery managed to get both the founder of Google Earth and Google Adense, as well as top top people in the field of accounting and law onto our board, so here I will explain how we found each board advisor. I&#8217;ll go more in-depth on our management team on a future blog.</p>\n<p>First of all, as a young team, we need a well-rounded advisory board who know what they are doing to guide us and prevent us from making bad decisions simply because of a lack of knowledge. We had in mind the exact expertise we are looking for, and applied good networking techniques to connect with them. As I pointed out in my eBook on networking I wrote two years ago, good networking has 6 Core Values: Integrity, Sincerity, Optimism, Confidence, Initiative, and Persistence. As long as you constantly apply these 6 core concepts in your life, doors will open up in life for you.</p>\n<p>For Avi (founder of Google Earth, or Earthviewer by Keyhole), we found his website and thought he was the perfect person on our board. I emailed him and said, &#8220;Hello! I saw your site and found it very interesting. I&#8217;m creating a Virtual World company aimed to enhance Productivity, and I would love to catch lunch/coffee with you some time in discussion of you possibly being our Board Advisory.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Sure! Lets talk some time!&#8221; There was actually a time where we had a miscommunication at the beginning, and the meeting did not happen. But after a few polite and happy follow ups, we finally got lunch, clicked pretty well, and he said our stuff is interesting so we can bounce ideas off him as an advisor.</p>\n<p>For Eytan (founder of Google Adsense), we went to a speaker event (go to lots of those, and ALWAYS connect with the speaker), and he was one of the speakers. My CMO Jun made a really good connection with him, and after hanging out a few times, Jun asked if Eytan would like to be a board advisory, and he said sure. Eytan has been really cool and already helped out with some of Future Delivery&#8217;s tough decisions.</p>\n<p>For Jake (our guru on accounting), I met him at a round-table event with UCLA Anderson School Board Advisors almost three years ago. The event is usually for Anderson MBA students, but I signed up as an associate and became one of the only undergrads who could go to all the MBA events. At the event, he was clearly one of the happiest people I have ever met. I respected the positive energy and influence he exerted towards the whole group, especially after experiencing so many things throughout his life. After the event, I scheduled a follow up and asked to meet up with him every once in awhile. As I started Future Delivery, I went for his advice, and he agreed to be part of the advisory board.</p>\n<p>Finally, for Albert (our Legal Expert who worked on the Myspace aquisition), I met Arman, the founder of one of the early dial-up companies who is now running a infrastructure/server company at an Entrepreneur Conference called Startup LA towards the end of last year. I followed up with him and ask to catch lunch some time. Arman and I clicked pretty well too, and he wants to help out Future Delivery. Our of a lot of great advice and offers, he referred me to his friend Albert. I scheduled a meeting with Albert, and we discussed our mutual interest in chess as well as some issues start ups deal with these days. He says virtual worlds is definitely something he is very interested in and wants to be a Board Advisor.</p>\n<p>Throughout my career, I have firmly believed that, when you meet passionate and motivated people with a sincere attitude, only good things can happen. Building relationships is one of the most important and meaningful things you can do in life, regardless if it is for professional or personal enrichment. Outside the comfort zone there is a harmless dragon that looks scary, but you are invincible to it.

        },
        "content": {
            "rendered": "<p><center>base=&#8221;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#8243;><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/jPnEtf2aPMo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" />\n(Note: this is just a summary intro and not the whole interview)</p>\n<p></center></p>\n<p>So in LA there&#8217;s a pretty prominent startup-focused organization called Mixergy, run by an awesome guy, Andrew Warner. Mixergy organizes events and interviews successful startup entrepreneurs to educate the world about how to become successful entrepreneurs. Andrew recently interviewed my Co-founder and CMO Jun Loayza for the latest episode, and I thought it was pretty awesome. I could probably have you download the interview from here, but I think it would be more fair if you went to his site to check the whole thing out, so go listen to the interview here.</p>\n<p>I thought the interview was pretty extraordinary. However, due to the time limitation and the nature of the interview, there were obviously some details that could not be expressed. For that reason, I would like to tell some of the missed stories about FD. OK, well, to be honest, I also thought I sounded like an introverted pervert in the interview and I wanted to bring myself a little justice \ud83d\ude42 I&#8217;ll do that at the end though.</p>\n<p><!--more-->The interview focused a lot on how we got some great free interns, and how to stand back up as an entrepreneur after failures. Since none of our initiatives has achieved high success yet, some may attribute that to our free help. So I thought it would be good to list some of the successes we had too to show that the people who helped really pushed us a good distance and that they should get more credit from their work.</p>\n<h3>The Future Delivery Story</h3>\n<p>For FD World, we really thought we could build the next society-changing product. Yes we were somewhat ambitious, but our CTO said it was a very doable goal. With his background, I believe we really had the chance (first employee Xerox hired in China R&amp;D, ran a successful software startup, lecturer at UCI, Toshiba Senior Engineer with 24 patents under his name).</p>\n<p>However, I want to emphasize that he dropped not because he didn&#8217;t get paid. In fact, he told his employer that once he gets his green card, he would quit immediately. He was very committed and put in a few thousands dollars of his own into the company too. However, the government changed policies during that time and his green card status was locked for another 2 years, so he had to drop. At that time even though we had already developed the virtual world to a certain state, we had to put the project on hold because of the unfortunate CTO event and the high capital required.</p>\n<p>For FDCareer, even though it didn&#8217;t achieve high success either (or yet), we did have some good victories. We got rated on Mashable as one of the Top Ten Social Networks for Gen-Ys; we established some good partnerships with companies like Disney Interactive Media Group; we got decent SEO such as top 5 results for &#8220;mckinsey compensation&#8221; or &#8220;nintendo culture&#8221; on Google. At one point we were offered a $400K investment too. However, that&#8217;s when the economy fell apart, and the investor&#8217;s own fund didn&#8217;t work out from within. We also felt that since companies were laying off people, they wouldn&#8217;t be thrilled about something that helps them hire more efficiently. So even though I believe that if we continued to work on FDCareer without worrying about money, it would become successful, we were pinned down to cash and weren&#8217;t able to make new features. Our momentum was hampered and had to regroup.</p>\n<p>At that point we wondered what can we do that is recession free. Since Jun became extremely involved in blogging and social media as CMO of the company, he pointed out that people would only use social media more during a recession. We decided that it would adhere to the FD core philosophy (being fun and productive), so we are launching the site Viralogy.com. I cannot tell you the rest of the story yet, but I can tell you that either its another story of failed passionate people who continued on doing exciting things, or a huge success that makes a difference in society. We&#8217;re hoping towards the latter \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<h3>I am not reserved. I am Yu-kai Chou.</h3>\n<p>So during the interview, I was more portrayed as an introverted, reserved guy who prefers to make friends online. Hahaha, I have NEVER heard anyone say that about me before. People have called me crazy or weird, but this is the first time I have heard of being reserved. I would definitely like to pull myself out of that impression before everyone makes fun of me.</p>\n<p>The first little detail I wanted to clarify is that my dropshipping business was actually my first and smallest business out of the other ones. During good weeks, I managed to make $2000 in revenue in a week while being extremely part-time (as opposed to $1000 in the month mentioned in the video). Obviously it wasn&#8217;t much either way, but that was 8 times the difference.</p>\n<p>When Jun met me, I was not running that company anymore (so it wasn&#8217;t specifically the calculators, GPS, and iPods I sold that made Jun realize the potentials of entrepreneurship). During that time, I started a non-profit aimed to connect different expertise together and it had some modest accomplishments. I then moved onto importing of components of construction machinery. Unfortunately that business didn&#8217;t take off after tons of work due to some partnership issues.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t blame Andrew to think I am more reserved and quiet. After all, he sees a lot of Jun all over the internet and throughout events, and the only time he&#8217;s seen me is in Living the Startup Life. In Living the Startup Life I do appear to be quite reserved and awkward for the camera, especially compared to the all-out Jun. It&#8217;s actually pretty funny because in the show, all the FD folks besides Jun appear unnatural when the camera is on them. We just enjoy being dorky when we&#8217;re together \ud83d\ude00</p>\n<p>In reality, I would even say that a lot of people I know have way more friends than me online, but I have more physical friends than almost everyone I know. Since I grew up from a diplomatic family, I moved from one place to another since I was young (Taiwan, South Africa, Taiwan again, Kansas, and California). Since my whole set of friends would switch every few years, I learned to make friends extra fast. Jun is a bit more selective in who he makes friends with, but I pretty much become good friends with everyone. I&#8217;m actually known to a lot of my business friends through my high energy level. I surprisingly found out when people approached me and mentioned that they already heard about my energy level and they want to discuss business.</p>\n<h3>Being behind the scenes doesn&#8217;t mean you are introverted</h3>\n<p>Jun being portrayed as the more sociable guy was a natural and almost planned thing. His job as the CMO is to become the face for the company and get everyone to know Future Delivery through him. I, on the other hand, believe that my role as a leader is to do all the non-glamorous things that no one wants to do (like accounting and dealing with angry clients) so that my teammates can all focus on what they love doing and can shine at.</p>\n<p>With that said, I do agree that I don&#8217;t have the charisma or hip style that Jun is naturally born with. When people meet Jun, they think he&#8217;s a cool guy that they want to be friends with. I think when people meet me, they just think I&#8217;m a smart and respectable person, but not the type that is charming or detail-oriented towards my appearance. I actually wrote a blogpost just on <a href=\"https://jsutshair.online/networking/how-to-successful-impressive/\" target=\"_blank\">how I dislike my image.</a></p>\n<h3>Work for Purpose, Not for Money</h3>\n<p>Andrew drilled into why people would want to work with us in FD without monetary compensation. I believe that people work for two reasons. One is to make money. The other is to make life more meaningful. Jun and I truly believe that FD makes a person&#8217;s life more meaningful than any well-paid job would. I think a trait that both Jun and I share is that we both have a thing where people want to work with us when they talk to us. For instance, I am taking a programming class right now (so I can be less dependent on programmers), and my instructor who is a middle-aged woman suddenly volunteered to work for FD without any pay. Now that&#8217;s not pitching students to work for free. That&#8217;s a professional instructor offering to work for free without me saying anything. I was surprised, but hey, that&#8217;s cool isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n",

Before the awards, people have selected from an ocean a startups and nominated one for each kind of award like Best CEO, Best Boostrapped, Best Innovation, Best App etc etc. Each award has 6 nominees, and in the actual award, they point out the winner and the runner up.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some cool people who showed up were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, Founder/CEO of <a href=\"http://facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>. Microsoft Chief Software Architect <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Ozzie\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Ozzie</a>, Amazon CTO <a href=\"http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Werner Vogels</a>, Google product chief <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer\" target=\"_blank\">Marissa Mayer</a>, Twitter founders <a href=\"http://evhead.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Evan Williams</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bizstone.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Biz Stone</a>, and Jack Dorsey, imeem founder Dalton Caldwell, FriendFeed founder <a href=\"http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Buchheit</a>, Y Combinator\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Graham</a>, Seesmic CEO Loic Le Meur, and Mahalo CEO <a href=\"http://calacanis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Calacanis</a>. In other words, this event is pretty important.</p>\n<p><!--more-->The thing about the actual ceremony, is that it&#8217;s run very much like a startup too&#8230;..and obviously techie. A lot of the stuff were seemingly low budget, people were not very organized, and the humor was not very humorous. They went very heavy with the sponsors too. What&#8217;s disappointing is that <a href=\"http://friendfeed.com/techcrunch?service=blog\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Arrington</a>, founder of Tech Crunch himself, did not show up.</p>\n<p>The Awards started with a video of the themed gorilla (I&#8217;m actually not entirely sure what&#8217;s the significance to it) waking up and doing mundane things in the morning and occasionally cussing about his frustrations with his apartment. I don&#8217;t really get it. It&#8217;s not funny, informative, nor insightful (unless it was too insightful I couldn&#8217;t see it). Then they jumped right into the awards.</p>\n<p>The awards was obviously about breezing through everything as fast as possible, which I don&#8217;t blame because it was quite boring and everyone was waiting for the Myspace Afterparty. They pretty much just listed the 6 technologies, had a 1-liner for it (sometimes they don&#8217;t even have that), and they announced the runner-up and winner. All that is usually done in 1 minutes. I was hoping to see some videos introducing the startups and breezing through some of its interfaces and successes. But nope, its just the logo hanging there. Nothing special.</p>\n<p>Techies and entrepreneurs are not actors. Some of the people who won the award got up, seemed a bit nervous, and tried to get off as soon as possible. Most of them stuck with the &#8220;this is for the users out there!&#8221; theme. Microsoft chief software architect Ray Ozzie, who won best Technology Innovation/Achievement with Live Mesh was obviously more trained and eloquent with his speeches. He had some humor by thanking everyone for being &#8220;open-minded&#8221; and voting for Microsoft. Truth be told, I think he just needs to tell all the Microsoft employees to vote for them, and they won&#8217;t be too far from victory. Tell their employees&#8217; families to vote for MS, and that would probably seal the deal. With that said, Microsoft does create pretty good technologies. They&#8217;re just too ambitious with features (hence bugs), and they are not that great with the making things user-friendly.</p>\n<p>There were a few interviews conducted with important folks like Marissa Mayer (I know her pretty well by now and her pretty crazy laugh), Paul Graham (someone I respect quite well), but overall the interview wasn&#8217;t very engaging and not high quality. I don&#8217;t think I learned much from them. Also, midway through the event, I was walking to the restroom while Twittering. A logistics management guy looked at me and said, &#8220;no cellphone uses at this place.&#8221; I politely answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m just Twittering with my phone.&#8221; He looked at me weirdly, and said &#8220;Well you can Twitter outside.&#8221; Somewhat meh and somewhat bleh. So much for social media.</p>\n<p>There were some interesting shows like the video above, but only a very few and not exactly awesome but pretty good. Also, more than once during the awards announcement, they read the wrong names because they had the wrong sheet of paper. There were so much stuff left on the podium, that they got a bit confused which one they should read. Stuff like that shouldn&#8217;t happen even at a high school prom announcement.</p>\n<p>Finally, I thought the ending touch was a bad one. They ended with the same gorilla going back home, doing mundane tasks, sits on his bed, and then checks all the sponsors websites for a few seconds each, and then went to bed. They made the audiance watch something for 5 minutes, in expectance of something funny or interesting, but no it was just showing the sponsors. Quite lame. Yes I understand the importance of sponsors and giving them a good deal and such, but at least they could make it more subtle and integrate it into good content. This is the opposite of embedded product placement. Its interruption marketing, which is obviously not popular. I bet no one will look at that and think, &#8220;Ah! ABCD.com looks so awesome! I&#8217;m going to check them out when I go home!&#8221; I think at the very least, they could add a line of text at the end saying, &#8220;Hey, at least we HAVE a revenue model! Enjoy the Afterparty!&#8221; That would add more humor to it and make people feel appreciated, instead of just being eye-ball zombies for sponsorships.</p>\n<p>As you can see, there is much to improve on for the Crunchies. However, they did it was a lot better than last years. Tech Crunch did explain a bit about all this by claiming that instead of saying they are the Oscar for Tech People (high hype), they view it as a big family gathering. I guess if you look at it that way, its not that terrible. Still boring though.</p>\n<p>The nice thing that made everything worth it was the Myspace Afterparty. I caught up with a bunch of friends and made some new ones. I saw Mark Zuckerberg walking by and I wanted to talk to him, but I was distracted by someone else and didn&#8217;t want to be rude. Mark&#8217;s not a big guy at all, but I like his leadership philosophy of &#8220;set the general direction, and then hire the best people you can.&#8221; Also met with my Twitter friend Adam Jackson and a few other folks.</p>\n<p>The most crazy thing is that I bumped into my high school friend from KANSAS Jonathan Yin, who works at Dropbox now. I have not talked to this guy for close to a decade, and we just randomly saw each other at the Crunchies. Its not everyday that you bump into a high school friend from Kansas I tell ya.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have a different opinion about the Awards Ceremony, or if you spotted something that I didn&#8217;t understand and stated out of ignorance. I hope the 3rd year will be a lot better! After all, we&#8217;re going close to the Crunchies 5 Year Hockeystick Projection Plan.</p>\n",

Right now my life is divided into a 7 areas: 1. FD World(Venture), 2. Facilitator for a powerful Think Tank, 3. Co-Founder of the Veridical Group(consulting firm) 4. Vice President of Professional Activities in Delta Sigma Pi(Business Fraternity) 5. Lead Advisor of the Board in Bruin Consulting, 6. Personal Development and Expression, 7. School and maybe GMAT.</p>\n<p>1. FD World is a Virtual World model that aims to make THIS world more productive and people more successful, which is the opposite of the escapism purpose in other virtual worlds used in the entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>2. The Think Tank is a group of highly intelligent(hmm\u2026and good looking) people each with their own specialty and resources/connections to collaborate with ideas and create synergies in influence towards Green Campaigns, social injustice and economics. With members like UC Student Regent D\u2019Artagnan Scorza and Sustainability Expert and Activist Michael Cox, the Think Tank is capable of making changes throughout the UC System and the Government in implementing Green Regulations towards companies, and other \u201cstuff.\u201d I\u2019m the facilitator of the group and I hope to create some value through this.</p>\n<p>3. Helping out my great friend Jun Loayza in starting his Small Business Consulting firm, the Veridical Group. I am developing the business analysis system that I created, Octalysis, which will be the main framework for VG, and we already have 2 clients, and 3 more lined up.<br />\n4. I am going to reengineer the professional structure of my big family Delta Sigma Pi(Business Fraternity) as VPPA and enhance the already-impressive professional culture and brand name of the fraternity.</p>\n<p>5. I will be the Lead Board Advisor of Bruin Consulting and work to preserve what the graduated founders have left for the next generation of the board. They are a strong group and I just have to make sure team morale is maintained and that \u201cBC Magic\u201d is still in the air.</p>\n<p>6. Just reading up on business books(Married to the Brand and other Entrepreneurship Stuff), articles(Mckinsey Global Institute, Harvard Business Review\u2026), podcasts, creating new relationsihps and strengthening old ones, and expressing myself/sharing knowledge through teaching and writing blogs like this one. I guess teaching chess is included in this section.<br />\n7. I\u2019m taking 3 classes during Summer Session A and the second half I am moving back to Taiwan to put together my programming team and maybe take a GMAT course. I don\u2019t know if an MBA would be greatly useful for my career path but it sounds like fun.</p>\n<p>So far this has been my corrupted week since my Bulgarian friend from Kansas is visiting me and we are just having lots of fun at the Getty Villa, Santa Monica Beach, Universal Studios, Sea World, E3 Party and what not. We then are going to North Cal to attend an entrepreneurship conference in Stanford, along with Jun. I\u2019ll meet up another great friend Alex Adams too, so that\u2019s cool. Finally I need to spend less time with girls although the body is quite weak sometimes. We\u2019ll see what happens.<br />\nLife is good and hopefully productive.</p>\n",

I understand what is great about this movie, but it does not mean we can neglect the little things that it does wrong. LOTR is the most famous movie with the most glitches I have ever seen. I understand that making a fantasy movie like this is not easy to be glitch free, but there are way too many. I have only seen the first part, the big battle of the 2nd part, and I decided not to watch the whole and the third part. Since what&#8217;s good about this movie is found everywhere, I&#8217;ll just talk about why I don&#8217;t like it. I&#8217;ll include the parts I&#8217;ve seen on the 2nd one too since it&#8217;s convinient to do so.<br />\nFirst lets give some point values:</p>\n<p>Video: 92<br />\nAudio: 90<br />\nScenes: 92<br />\nGeneral Plot: 87<br />\nSpecific Plot: 83<br />\nIntensity: 82<br />\nConsistency: 88<br />\nGlitches: -12 (avg is -3)</p>\n<p>As you seen all the stuff are pretty solid. The only thing I can pick out of the movie, besides the glitches is the slow pace. The movie doesn&#8217;t seem to have a fast pace, and with 3 hours of this, you get quite tired watching it.</p>\n<p>Yea, I&#8217;ll get to the point, what are all the glitches that I am talking about? Well, first, glitches are more oftenly seen the 2nd time watching the movie, I have only seen it once, so ones I didn&#8217;t identify doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not there. But I can already tell you a plethora of it:</p>\n<p>(Yes, I realize this is just a movie and meant to just entertain, but it is also art and make-believe, so it should not constantly remind you that &#8220;Yo, I&#8217;m just a movie! I don&#8217;t need to make sense!&#8221; Even Muholland Drive made sense.)</p>\n<p>1. During the first part, there was a place where the big fire devil(pardon me for not remembering much names, I&#8217;m not aquainted to Tolkiens&#8217; book and only seen the movie once. But one should not let the book influence a movie rating) was chasing the fellowship. They were running on the stairs and the place is so crappy that their weight made the stairs fall down. So the question is, if those little guys can make the stairs fall down, HOW IN THE WORLD DOES THAT FIRE DEVIL RUN AROUND AND CHASE THEM!???? Oh, maybe he can fly&#8230;but wait! He fell down with Gandolf! He can&#8217;t fly, he just magically appeared to catch up to everyone. It looked more like a video game to me at that part where you keep running in one direction and someone is chasing you and will never catch you, when you finish the level, it catches up and you have to fight the boss&#8230;.^^||</p>\n<p>2. Wraiths suck!!! From the description in the movie, wraithes are described as super powerful beings. There&#8217;s 9 of them in the world and it seems like each one of them can defeat a thousand men. What I saw in the movie is&#8230;. The only thing they do is ride horse and scare short people. They are afraid of fire, they are afraid of water. Six of them were trying to kill Frodo and one human with a torch scared them away&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know what kind of definition of suck would you use, but they suck. My friends told me they&#8217;re better in the book; the book doesn&#8217;t count in the movie. My friends also said: &#8220;What makes them so powerful is that they can&#8217;t die! You just can&#8217;t kill them! Anything that can&#8217;t die is scary and powerful&#8230;&#8221; Then i bring up my favorite analogy. You&#8217;ve played Super Mario 3 yea?(best Nintendo game ever) In it there&#8217;s this skeleton turtle that when you step on it, it turns into bones and then it revives a few seconds later. Even though they can&#8217;t die, they are still WORTHLESS!(Sincere Apologies for those who suffer from these creatures in the game, but then it just means you suck too.) They have no threat. (I know you can find ways to kill them, but not my point). Anyway, the wraiths suck. Then my friend told me in the 2nd and 3rd one they become more powerful, and I said &#8220;Good! That&#8217;s more like it!&#8221; But then I discovered they are more powerful just because they are riding on dragons!!!! Frodo can be more powerful when he&#8217;s riding on a dragon too. Oh yea&#8230;finally, I heard one or some died because the girl stabbed a dagger in them&#8230;&#8230;.point made.</p>\n<p>3. The fact that the elf guy constantly have like 8 arrows left all the time and has time (explained in the book&#8230;.) to pick them all back when surrounded by thousands of orc is just a little glitch.</p>\n<p>4. The Dramatic place where the Dark Lord got his finger chopped off, starting the whole thing is pretty dumb. The human had a broken sword, he hit the dark lord&#8217;s finger. The dark lord loses all the power and dies&#8230; This does&#8217;nt make sense. The dark lord has all his powers, perhaps because the rings fulls his body with energy. The guy slashes at the dark lord, his finger, close to the ring, is suppose to be one of the lords toughest places. Yea they made it dramatic, but in reality situations, the guy would slash at the dark lord (first the dark lord is powerful enough not to let the guy touch him) and then when he hits the finger, the broken sword will instantly turn to dust and the dark lord will laugh and all is to a end&#8230;.yea, atleast they should make the dark lord fall in a more probable way. If this was the ending of a great epic itself, wouldn&#8217;t the view/reader be pissed? Why can&#8217;t the Dark Lord just trip, hit his head, and die, hoping he has insurance?</p>\n<p>5. This is more of an understanding part. Frodo puts on the ring and becomes invisible, where is the dark POWER? How come the dark lord doesn&#8217;t become invisible?</p>\n<p>6. The magicians fight&#8230;is funny. Goes like this. A shakes staff, B hits wall. B shakes staff, A hits the wall, so on. What the hell are they doing?? Are they playing RPG? I&#8217;m sure they are desperate on waiting their bar to fill and regret that they didn&#8217;t put more points in speed&#8230;.WHAT ARE THEY DOING? It should go like this, A makes B hits the wall, and does it again, and again, and again, and again, and makes him spin in the air until his bones shatter, and then make him hit the wall 10 times more&#8230;that&#8217;s realistic fighting if they really have those powers! They are like, &#8220;Go hit the wall! Ok, now it&#8217;s your turn.&#8221; And then the bad guy suddenly gets smarter and wins&#8230;.wow, best fight I have ever seen.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s some really minor ones that I&#8217;m just too tired to talk about them now.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll move on to the 2nd part. Realized I just watch about 20 minutes of it and I can pick out a few.</p>\n<p>1. The Ent tree thing was carrying the 2 halfings for a whole day, and then he suddenly saw all the dead trees and got mad (He should kill humans too), he cried out loud and in 2 seconds the whole Ent race appeared ready for battle. Ummm&#8230;if the whole Ent race can appear in 2 seconds, WHAT WAS HE DOING WALKING FOR A WHOLE DAY WITH THE HALFLINGS ON HIS BACK?? Yea, maybe all the Ents were stockers.</p>\n<p>2. The elf guy can shoot a orc in the head when it&#8217;s half a mile away. When it really matters, when he should kill the orc with a torch 500 ft away, he shoots the shoulder, and then the other shoulder, and watches the kamakazi succeed&#8230;.</p>\n<p>3. The dwarf jumped up and landed into the mass of Orcs&#8230;who had spears! This is butt and leg first. I&#8217;m surprised there was place for him to land. Does no one know what a spear is for? Maybe they just wanted to make the movie less violent so they don&#8217;t want to show raw dwarf on a stick&#8230;..</p>\n<p>4. When they were on the bridge filled with orcs, they rode horses through the bridge like knife thru butter and the orcs all fell off the bridge. Wait&#8230;.horses are more powerful than orcs? One horce in front can knock aside 30 orcs? Well, maybe they are more powerful, but then WHY DOESN&#8217;T THEY JUST TRAIN 1000 HORSEMEN AND JUST CONSTANTLY RIDING BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH? That way all the orcs will die(if not damaged) no? Oh, I later heard that&#8217;s kinda what happened. Orcs are war creatures designed to kill.</p>\n<p>Well, anyway, those are the ones I still remember. Probably lots more. LOTR is really a good movie, but the glitches pulled it down alot, so it can&#8217;t make my collection.Too too many&#8230;. If you can refute me, plz do. I like being convinced wrong, though there might be some inevitable resistence. Feel free to msg me.</p>\n<p>Last thing to keep in mind, this review I wrote in my 12th grade, but I have brought it back up again and again when people ask why I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the best movie ever. I thought I&#8217;d just bring it onto facebook. If you read up to this point, eprops to you.</p>\n",

It will help you understand the behavior better. Hope this helps!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twinfluence.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twinfluence</a> (Measure your Twitter influence through tweets, reach of followers as well as second-order followers): This tool is really good. It is a sophisticated way of measuring how influential you are on Twitter. <strong>9/10</strong> </p>\n<p>Twitter-Friends (analyzes a whole set of data, especially focusong on how &#8220;sticky&#8221; you are, as well as inactive friends or those who are online now): This App seems to have a lot of great features and interesting stats. It brings up a lot of interesting information and quotients about a user. It mostly focuses on how &#8220;social&#8221; a user is, instead of how many followers he has. Slightly overboard but quite awesome. <strong>8/10</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitterratio.com/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Ratio</a> (Find out your friend to follower ratio): I don&#8217;t find this one that great. Its just simple math: followers/followings. Yea, maybe you won&#8217;t know the EXACT number in 2 seconds, but who needs to know? It adds a little humor to the site though. <strong>3/10</strong> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.grader.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Grader</a> (find out your twitter grade. Computed based on how complete your profile is as well as the number and influence of your followers.): I don&#8217;t necessarily find the Grader that great. It does factor in some interesting things like how complete is your profile, tweeting behavior and follower influence, but overall it is somewhat dull because it doesn&#8217;t show you anything besides a number. Nice interface though. <strong>6/10</strong> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tweetstats.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweet Stats</a> (Graph your tweet activity): This is probably the best tool to measure how you waste your time on Twitter. It not only tells you how often you tweet, it tells you when you usually tweet, on what device. <strong>8/10</strong> </p>\n<p> Tweeple Twak (Track your friend gains and declines plus a whole set of functions): OK, this site is still in private alpha, but we&#8217;ll see if they have the next great app. <strong>?/10</strong> </p>\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.twitgraph.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twit Graph</a> (Graph your tweeting activity): This is OK. Has potential, but can&#8217;t compare to Tweet Stats. The information is not particularly useful either. <strong>5/10</strong>  <a href=\"http://twitemperature.com\" target=\"_blank\">TwiTemperature</a>(Measures how &#8220;hot&#8221; are you by comparing you to what others are tweeting about): I find this somewhat meaningless. If you are saying what everyone else is saying, you are hot. If you can come up with original things to say, you are freezing. The humor and image makes a good laugh though. <strong>4/10</strong></p>\n<p>Find this Useful?

Hope this helps!</p>\n<p><strong>Topics by Search:</strong></p>\n<dl>\n<dt> <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Search</a> (Search for the latest trends on Twitter): Most basic. Difficult access, but fast and MOST up to date. Also updates real time. <strong>8/10</strong> </dt>\n</dl>\n<p> </p>\n<dl>\n<dt> Flaptor Search (A search tool that can be installed on your browser): OK. Less up-to-date. Fast. Nice going with browser. Unnecessary if you have TweetDeck. <strong>7/10</strong> </dt>\n</dl>\n<p> </p>\n<dl>\n<dt> <a href=\"http://tweetscan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweet Scan</a> (Search keywords and people on Twitter): Very Slow. Doesn&#8217;t find relevant info. Not very up to date. Pretty bad. <strong>3/10</strong> </dt>\n</dl>\n<p> </p>\n<dl>\n<dt> <a href=\"http://www.twitterment.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitterment</a> (Search Twitter users and topics): Fast but just does a Google search relating to Twitter. Pretty useless. <strong>2/10</strong></dt>\n<p>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt> <a href=\"http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/\" target=\"_blank\">TweetDeck Search</a> (Desktop App that also has Search Functions): TweetDeck is one of the most amazing Twitter Apps because it makes almost all your Twitter activities easier and faster. After the DL, its search is easy to access and updates real time. Highly Recommended. <strong>9/10</strong></dt>\n<p></dl>\n<p><strong>Topics by Type</strong></p>\n<dl>\n<dt> <a href=\"http://www.tweetmeme.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetmeme</a> (find out the latest Stories on Twitter by type of file): Well designed, very inviting, good topics, you can choose what type of files you like (image, video, audio etc etc). One problem is lack of info on how its compiled. <strong>7/10</strong> </dt>\n</dl>\n<p><strong>Topics by Hype</strong></p>\n<dl>\n<dt> <a href=\"http://twitturly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitturly</a> (Find out the most talked about stories on Twitter based on Links): Good info. Nicely done. Does not show the content very well. <strong>8/10</strong> </dt>\n</dl>\n<p></p>\n<dl>\n<dt> Twitscoop (A search tool that tracks trends as well as certain events): Well made. Tag Cloud finally put in good use. Easy to browse, easy to access and very up to date. Chosen by Tweetdeck. <strong>9/10</strong> </dt>\n</dl>\n<p> </p>\n<dl>\n<dt> Favotter (Find out the most favored tweets): This idea is very good . Fewer tweets get favorited than RTed, so it must be quality stuff. Not much news but some witty lines. Helps you be a better Tweeter. <strong>8/10</strong> </dt>\n</dl>\n<p><strong>Topics by Special Interest</strong></p>\n<dl>\n<dt> <a href=\"http://twistori.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twistori</a> (Find out what tweeter&#8217;s loves, hates, believes, etc.): This is awesome. It lets you understand the world better and connect with people better. However, it does not link to the actual tweeters.
